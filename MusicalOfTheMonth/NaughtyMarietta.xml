SCENE: The Place d&#39;Armes.<lb/>
</head>
<stage>
A broad open space with the levee
at back. There is a path along
this levee bordered on both sides
by tall trees, some of which are
draped with the gray Southern moss.
There is just a glimpse of the
Mississippi between these trees.
Along the levee from time to time
as act progresses, people of
various nationalities past.
Mexicans, Indians, Spaniards,
Negroes, etc. At extreme L. is
an arcaded street in which are
booths for flower sellers, cake
and confectionary - sailors, etc.
Over this arcade are the high latticed
windows of dwellings in old 
Creole style. There is a door at
L. into one of these houses. At
right is the getaway entrance to
the St. Louis Cathedral. Up
stage in centre is a large fountain.
The top of the fountain is
in the form of a large urn. The
pedestal leading from the basin to
the urn must be large enough for
a person to stand up in. The
fountain is dry.
</stage>
<stage>
DISCOVERED: At rise of curtain it is just dawn.
The sky shows crimson and gold
over the river. Some BEGGARS are
asleep at base of fountain. The
music is soft and low.

<stage>(At close of chorus enter from R.1.E.
ETIENNE GRANDET, the son of the
Lieutenant-Governor. He is a young
man of very elegant manners and
dress. Full of the gallantry and
extreme courtesy of a beau of the
times. He is supposed to be
merely a social butterfly but is
in reality the pirate Bras Pique,
whose band of buccaneers is the
terror of the whole coast)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Girls</speaker>
<stage>(Ad lib)</stage><p>Monsieur Etienne. Welcome back. Welcome home. 
<stage>(Girls rush forward and greet him)</stage></p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Ah, Felice, Nanette, Fanchon. And how goes everything in 
Little Paris?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Felice</speaker>
<p>Oh, Monsieur. New Orleans no longer deserves the name of 
Little Paris with you away.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Nanette</speaker>
<stage>(Offering flower)</stage>
<p>Will Monsieur wear a rose?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Felice</speaker>
<p>No. No. My jessamine.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanchon</speaker>
<p>Ah no. The Fleur de Lis --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>
Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(Taking the Fleur de Lis and putting
it in his buttonhole)</stage>
<p>Surely the flower of France, since I am so loyal a subject
<pb/>
of his gracious Majesty. Come, what is the news in Little
Paris? What fortunes have been lost at dice? Who won the
lottery? Who has stolen whose sweetheart?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanchon</speaker>
<p>Oh, Monsieur. There is no scandal when you are away.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(Laughing)</stage>
<p>Rather a back-handed compliment, my dear.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Felice</speaker>
<p>But such excitment -- Bras Pique, the pirate is abroad 
again.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Indeed?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Nanette</speaker>
<p>He has scarcely allowed one ship to come safely in harbor 
since you sailed.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Felice</speaker>
<p>And Monsieur, the Place d&#39;Armee is haunted.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>
Haunted, ha, ha!
</p>
<stage>(Looks about laughing)</stage>
<p>Rather an open, airy place for a ghost.</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Felice</speaker>
<p>It is true. You shall hear --- A voice in the air - singing 
-- But the voice comes from nowhere ---</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Nanette</speaker>
<p>They say it is the spirit of someone who went down in the
last vessel scuttled by Bras Pique.</p></sp>

<stage>(THEY ALL cross themselves)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha! Nonsense.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Felice</speaker>
<p>But &#39;tis true, Monsieur. Everyone has heard it. The voice,
so sweet -- so mysterious. It begins a melody and then
dies away.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fanchon</speaker>
<p>It goes like this --</p>
<stage>(She hums the refrain of Marietta&#39;s
dream melody)</stage>
<lg><l>La, la, la, la, etc.</l></lg></sp>
<pb/>

<stage>(Knife grinder&#39;s bell can be heard
off U.C.)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Someone is playing you tricks.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanchon</speaker>
<p>No. No. Even Pere Antoine has heard it. He has had prayers 
said.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Knife Grinder</speaker>
<p>Knives to grind! Knives and scissors to grind.</p></sp>

<stage>(ADAH, Etienne&#39;s quadroon slave and
mistress, opens lattice of window
over arcade)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Adah</speaker>
<stage>(To Knife Grinder)</stage><p>Here! My shears. 
<stage>(Throws scissors to man, sees Etienne)</stage></p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Nanette</speaker>
<stage>(Aside to other Girls)</stage><p>We had better leave or we shall have our faces scratched for 
talking to him.</p></sp>

<stage>(ETIENNE takes bunch of roses from
NANETTE and throws them up to Adah)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Adah</speaker>
<p>Oh Master, it has been so long -- I feared --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(Laughing)</stage><p>You feared perhaps that I had been spliced to the yard arm 
by Bras Pique.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Adah</speaker>
<p>Oh no! Not you. Will you come in?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Presently.</p></sp>

<stage>(ADAH goes in from balcony closing
window)</stage>

<stage>(Enter te TWO PIRATES, L.C.)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Fanchon</speaker>
<p>Look, Monsieur. Pirates? 
<pb/></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Nonsense! Just innocent sailors on shore leave. The
Casquette girls are about to land and they are here for the
fun.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fanchon, Felice, Nanette</speaker>
<p>Oh we must see the Casquette Girls too.</p>
<p>Come, au revoir, Monsieur!</p></sp>

<stage>(ALL throw kisses to him as they run
off R.U.)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Au revoir!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>1st Pirate</speaker>
<stage>(To Etienne)</stage>
<p>Master Pique!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Not Pique here!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>1st Pirate</speaker>
<p>
We cannot land our goods at Barataria.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>And what have I to do with you and your goods, my good fellow? 
<stage>(Goes toward house L)</stage></p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>1st Pirate</speaker>
<p>
But Master, Captain Richard Warrington, the American, guards
the coast for mile around the storehouses.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>In faith, &#39;tis a pretty pass when a gentleman may be accosted
in the streets by a pack of ruffianly buccaneers. I shall
have to inform my father, the Lieutenant-Governor, of this
state of affairs, I shall indeed.</p></sp>
<stage>(He again attempts to pass them)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>1st Pirate</speaker>
<p>But, Master -</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(Turning upon him sternly)</stage><p>
Enough. You know where you may see your master. And,
Manuelo, as you value your ability to wear those pretty earrings,
never let this happen again. Adieu!</p></sp>
<stage>(Exit house R)</stage>

<stage>(SAILORS look after him a moment)</stage>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>2nd Pirate</speaker>
<p>What did I tell you, Manuelo?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>1st Pirate</speaker>
<p>
He is the Devil, Bras Pique! He fears nothing.
</p></sp>

<stage>(THEY go up to Knife Grinder and
throw him their knives to grind)</stage>

Town Crier
</speaker>
<stage>(Entering R)</stage>
<p>Hear ye! Hear ye all. The King of France has sent a shipment

<p>
Go to palace at once. Present these letters to the

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>And me?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>And why you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Why me, he asks! Was it not understood that I was to serve
you until - <hi rend="underline">until</hi>, mark you - I could find an opportunity
that will place me in the environment to which I have always
been accustomed?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<stage>(With a laugh)</stage><p>And what good will it do you if I include you in the audience 
to the governor?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>I want to hear everything that&#39;s going on. I&#39;m a servant - 
but I&#39;m a temperamental servant.</p></sp>

<sp>

<stage>(Enters form house R)</stage>
<p>One moment, my good man.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>I am <hi rend="underline">his</hi> good man -- for the present.</p></sp>

<stage>(ETIENNE approaches CAPTAIN DICK)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>If I mistake not, I am addressing Captain Richard Warrington.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>At your service, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>I am Etienne Grandet, the son of the Lieutenant Fovernor.
You may present your letters in person. My father will
receive you as soon as he has disposed of the King&#39;s casket
maids.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Thank you, but my letters are to Governor Le Farge.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Governor Le Farge sailed last month on a private mission to 
France. My father is in authority meanwhile.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Oh in that case -- of course -- Silas, the letters.</p>
<stage>(He takes letters from SILAS. To
Etienne)</stage>
<p>We have permission on from your king to attempt the capture of
this buccaneer, Bras Pique, who has made it a hazardous venture
for English ships to bring us supplies.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Yes -- we will splice him with his own yard arm!</p></sp>

<stage>(He tries to break into the conversation,
each time THEY push him back)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Indeed? That is good news. I trust you may be successful.
But is not New Orleans a strange place for an attack on this</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<stage>(Laughing)</stage><p>Oh, as to that, we are in New Orleans only for a few days. 
My men are looking for --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Harry</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Trouble -- what kind? We can perhaps oblige.</p></sp>

<p>The worst trouble, wives.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Harry</speaker>
<p>My friend here, is an acknowledged woman hater.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>You see, sir, he doesn&#39;t attract the ladies -- How I love 
the darlings. Why? Because they love me.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>No one addressed you, Silas.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Oh, very well. 
<pb/></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<stage>(To Etienne)</stage>
<p>My lads have heard what fine wives the King&#39;s casket maids
make, and when they learned that a fresh shipment was to be
disposed of here in New Orleans, nothing would do but every
one of them must run his head into the matrimonial noose.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>And let me tell you - to get caught in that <hi rend="underline">noose</hi> is not 
<hi rend="underline">nice</hi>.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<stage>(Roaring)</stage>
<p>Quiet!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<stage>(Quickly)</stage>
<p>Here you are, sir.</p>
<stage>(He clamps his hand over his own
mouth)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Is it the girls or the well filled caskets which the king 
sends with him that attracts the men?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Harry</speaker>
<p>Sir. That is not a very gallant remark for a Frenchman.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>No harm meant. You, I take it, are Irish?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Harry</speaker>
<p>Take it or leave it, I am.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>And I -- sir, am a rising American. Submerged at present, 
but looking for my opportunity.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(Laughing)</stage><p>
Indeed?</p>
<stage>(To Dick and Harry)</stage>
<p>If you will excuse me, Messieurs, I will tell my father of
your arrival.
</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>We shall be obliged.</p></sp>

<stage>(ETIENNE exits with elaborate bows

<stage>(SILAS, taking the bows for himself,
bows respectedly in imitation of him

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Harry</speaker>
<p>He bows too much. I don&#39;t like the French.</p></sp>

<stage>(He goes off R. as the music of
CASKET MAIDS is heard)</stage>

</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Indian</speaker>
<p>Ugh! Ugh!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>It must have a double meaning.</p></sp>

Those Indians, the way they strut. You&#39;d think they <hi rend="underline">owned</hi>

<stage>(He sees Lizette)</stage>
<p>Hello, what&#39;s your name?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Lizette - and I&#39;m looking for a husband.

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>My name&#39;s Silas Slick - and I&#39;m looking for a good offer.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Are your intentions serious?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>It depends - that casquette, the King gave you. Is it 
valuable?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<stage>(Taking out casquette and dangling
it before him)</stage>
<p>Here it is -- but it&#39;s not to be opened until <hi rend="underline">after</hi> the
wedding.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>H-m-m - doesn&#39;t look as if there&#39;s much gold in it.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<stage>(Indignantly)</stage>
<p>Is it the gold or me you&#39;re interested in?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>A little of both - with the gold running slightly in the lead.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>I tell you what I&#39;ll do. I&#39;ll go to the storehouse and
look over the crop of prospective husbands. If they&#39;re not
any better than you - I&#39;ll come back and consider your
proposal.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>

<p>Dear me! Florence, fold the umbrella straight and don&#39;t

Governor!</p></sp>

<stage>(Enter ETIENNE hurriedly from R.1.E.)</stage>

<sp>

<p>Ah, Father!</p></sp>

<p>So you are back!</p></sp>

<stage>(Coming down and taking him aside)</stage>
<p>Did you have a - er - prosperous voyage to France?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(Laughing)</stage><p>To France! Oh come, you need not keep up this pretense with 
me, old side partner!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Don&#39;t call me side partner. You know I don&#39;t like it.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>But you are, you know. I do all the work. You protect me

<sp><speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Ssh!</p>
<stage>(Looking around apprehensively at
Florence)</stage>
<p>I don&#39;t know what you are talking about. A public official

<stage>(Speaking to Dick and Harry)</stage>
<p>Ah, gentlemen!</p>

<stage>(DICK and HARRY come downstage)</stage>
<p>
Father, allow me to present Captain Richard Warrington and
Sir Henry Blake.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>We are honored, sir. We have a warrant from your king to 
attempt the capture of Bras Pique!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Eh? 
<pb/></p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>We shall need your signature.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>We must give them every assistance, Father.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Oh, assuredly. Assuredly! Bye and bye. At present, urgent
affairs call me.</p></sp>
<stage>(Goes off R.U. with FLORENCE)</stage>

<sp><speaker>
Sir Harry</speaker>
<stage>(Aside to Dick)</stage>
<p>In faith, Monsieur Bye and Bye will be of no great assistance
to us.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>You must be patient with my father, Monsieur. He has much
on his mind. He is on his way to dispose of the girls whom
the King has sent here to wed our settlers.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>
Sir Harry</speaker>
<p>Ah! Speaking of those Casquette girls - tell me - have
you any news of the pretty little devil who escaped from
them?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Escaped!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sir Harry</speaker>
<p>Yes! From Mozambique where we saw them land -- my friend
here is dying for news of her.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Nothing of the kind. I noticed her because she was different 
from the others.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sir Harry</speaker>
<p>Yes, she was a fiery Italian girl and when the little devil
learned that every Casquette girl was obliged to choose a
husband, she said she&#39;d take Dick.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>No!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Harry</speaker>
<p>Yes -- and when Dick politely refused her, she up and struck
him across the face with her gloves.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Oh, it was nothing.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sir Harry</speaker>
<p>And in the night, what did she do but up and vanish through
the keyhold like smoke.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>That&#39;s strange, but, gentlemen, if you will join me at
Antoine&#39;s Inn -- he has a pretty daughter who may do as
well.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I must find ledgings for my men first -- we will see you
later, if we may.</p></sp>
<stage>(Going towards R.U.)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Well -- why not, then?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Why did you run away from the camp at Mozambique?</p></sp>

<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Mischeviously)</stage><p>For fear you make me to <hi rend="underline">marry</hi> you!

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I make you -- whatever gave you that idea?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>You maybe take serious that little joke of mine at Mozambique?
I only said that to gain time -- I would not choose you --
of all others.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Believe me, the incident is forgotten -- as for marrying, 
no thought is further from my mind.</p></sp>

<p>And me too!</p></sp>

<p>Me too!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>But you must marry. You have accepted the King&#39;s casket.</p></sp>

<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>I throw it overboard - long time ago. The Casket! Bah!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>What are you going to do?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>You must find me another dress.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>What?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Certainly -- you must get me -- what you say -- a disguise.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>A disguise? I should say not.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Can I stay forever sitting in zat fountain like a bird on

<p>But --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>But --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Calmly)</stage>
<p>Accordingly -- you must arrange for me something!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I -- why should I --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Who else? You are my friend -- it is arranged -- is it not?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>It is not -- arranged!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Besides -- ze whole -- thing is your fault.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>My fault? why?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Because. Anyway it is. If you had not make me angry, oh
but so angry, at Mozambique -- perhaps I don&#39;t know -- maybe
I not run away.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Do you know, I should take you at once to the Governor.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>But you will not?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Eh?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>You are stupid, but not cruel!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Stupid?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Like all men, maybe a little more stupid. You will get me
the little dress. What you say? Skin and fur from here
down, like a boy -- mais the other part -- perhaps a little
becoming wiz lace? Yes!</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I&#39;ll do nothing of the kind.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Oh, but if you could see how -- what you say -- attractive
I am in zose things from here down like a boy! Come, it is
arrange! I will be one of your soldiers. &quot;Tramp! Tramp!
Tramp!&quot; and when I am tire&#39;, you can carry me!
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>It&#39;s preposterous!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Of course it is pre---- that word you say. So you will hide

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Yes, Captain --</p></sp>

Marionette Theatre on the Rue -- Rue Canondelet. Bring him

<sp>

<p>Mercy! Remember I&#39;m a nervous woman! You can at least direct

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I cannot. I am strange here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>My opinion is you&#39;d be strange anywhere. I shouldn&#39;t have

<p>Captain, here&#39;s Rudolfo. May I go?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Yes, you have the day to yourself.</p>

<stage>(Exit SILAS R.U.)</stage>

<p>Ah, you are Rudolfo, the keeper of the Marionette Theatre
in the Rue Canondelet.</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>Si, Signor, poor Rudolfo! Who loss da leeetle son Rafaello,

<sp><speaker>Rudlofo</speaker>
<p>You bring me word of my Rafaello! Oh, Signor! Heaven bless
you. Permit-a me to salute.</p></sp>
<stage>(Attempt to kiss Captain Dick on
cheeks)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>That will do!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>Where is he, my Rafaello?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>He&#39;s safe enough at my father&#39;s plantation in Kentucky. He
is my mother&#39;s page boy where he does nothing all day with
infinite grace.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>Does nothing-a. Ah! That-a would please my Rafaello! He
no like - pulls de Marionetta. He no like-a da organ-a.
He no like-a da monk. He damn poor Italian. Oh, Signor.
Safe and happy. I am your slave! I kiss your hands, your
feet.</p>

<stage>(MARIETTA peeps from behind fountain.

I am forever your slave. How can I serve you?

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<stage>(Pointing to Marietta)</stage><p>Your boy was just so tall. 
<pb/></p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>Perhaps, yes.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>As I remember, this young lady is not unlike Rafaello?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Oh I see, I see!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>You will take this girl. Give her proper clothing and announce 
that your son has returned.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Oh excellente! Excellente! I kiss your hands, your cloak! 
But your cheek -- no, never!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>I no understand.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>There are reasons why she must remain unknown in New Orleans

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>You shall be well repaid, Rudolfo.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes. My gold is almost gone, but my friend has plenty. 
You shall be well paid. Come, I must take off this dress.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Here! You may have my cloak.

<p>Well?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Can you not finish my melody?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Finish it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>You see that is a dream melody! I hear it -- so many times
when I got to sleep -- and it has been foretold me, that
only he shall claim my heart, who will have power to sing
the answer to it!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Then why ask me?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Oh, of course you cannot. Being only my friend you would 
not even try, eh?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I&#39;d most assuredly will not try.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>No, of course, I could not expect -- You will not even try
--Come, padre mio --</p>
<stage>(She goes out humming meldoy)</stage>
<p>You will not even try?</p></sp>

<p>What is it then?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>I&#39;m such a nervous woman.</p></sp>

<p>Historical -- Are you so old as that?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Old! I&#39;m only, only --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Better hurry, Madam. Every minute makes it worse.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>I should say it does -- Here I am verging on -- twenty, and 
would you believe me, I have never had a proposal.</p></sp>

<sp>

<p>I would believe you.

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>At the boat -- where we landed, there was scores of men
following each girl -- all but me. What&#39;s the matter with
my face?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>I don&#39;t know. Who did it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>The King guaranteed husbands. If he hadn&#39;t I would never
have come away so far from home and mother -- and lugging
this heavy Casquette.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<stage>(Eagerly)</stage><p>It <hi rend="underline">is</hi> heavy then. </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Does it jingle when you shake it?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Of course, there&#39;s gold in it -- Would you marry me for my 
gold?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>For what other reason --- I -- I love you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>You?! Why?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>I don&#39;t know -- it just came over me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>You are nothing but a servant.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Ah, but my bondage will not, cannot, last forever. I but 
await my opportunity. In the meanwhile I am in training.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>In training?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Yes, to be a pirate.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>A pirate. Mercy! Remember I&#39;m a nervous woman.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>You see. My arm is already tabooded. </p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Tabooded!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Yes. See! I have the name of Bras Pique tabooded here 
with indelicate ink.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Are you Bras Pique?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Not yet. But some day -- with the help of Captain Dick --
we will scuttle his vessel. It will be my opportunity. I
will take his place -- I shall buccaneer all over the seas.
Bras Pique the Second!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Who would have thought it, a man like you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>

<p>While your Excellency was asleep at the Convent --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Sleep! I never sleep -- I&#39;m a servant of the people.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>While your Excellency was as -- I mean resting, - at the
Convent - there came three survivors from the Italian vessel
captured by Bras Pique!</p></sp>

<stage>(Enter ETIENNE, R.U.)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Survivors! Why survivors!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>That&#39;s what I say, why survivors?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>They were marooned and escaped. They bring dispatches from 
the King of France.</p></sp>

<p>And of course it must be this important one who is missing?</p></sp>

<sp>

<p>The Countess d&#39;Altena! Why, that is one of the richest and 
most powerful families in Italy. We must find her ---</p></sp>

<sp>

<p>And of course something disagreeable is promised me if I 
fail to find this maid?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>My men have marooned the Governor on the Isle of Pines.
When the right moment comes, we shall announce Louisiana

France ----</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Hush! Hush! This is no place -- besides -- I&#39;ll not take

your schemes fall through.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Did I not tell you to search every law and precedent to make things

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>Yes, Excellency.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Then why have I never heard of this most convenient instituion

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>The law is old, obsolete, I think.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>

<p>Then thank your lucky stars you met me. </p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>It must be easy -- some sort of a sitting-down position.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>Providence led you to me.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>I know. It&#39;s a great chance for you. I&#39;m a rising American --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>In the name of the Lieutenant-Governor I offer you the magnificent 
post of Whipping Boy.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>I don&#39;t like the name. I refuse it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>Wait! Wait! Let me read to you the prerequisites which go
with the post of Whipping Boy.</p>
<stage>(Searches in book)</stage>
<p>&quot;The Whipping Boy shall receive three suite of fine marquisette
embellished with gold braid.&quot;</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Real gold?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>Eighteen karat. &quot;He shall dine at the royal table and shall 
first taste of each delicate viand set before his royal master.&quot;</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Wait -- why first?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>In case the food be poisoned.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>And you call that a fine position?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>Oh, but that will never happen.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>I don&#39;t want the position. It sounds almost dangerous.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>But listen -- I have not read all.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>You&#39;ve read enough. 
<pb/></p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>&quot;His wife shall sit next the Grand Marshall.&quot;</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>I don&#39;t know about that. What kind of a person is this
Grand Marshall -- Maybe I couldn&#39;t trust my wife. I don&#39;t
think much of this position - Let&#39;s call it off.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>&quot;In addition the Whipping Boy shall receive the sum of ten 
thousand francs per annum.&quot;</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<stage>(Who has been going off)</stage>
<p>Ten thousand francs. Well, maybe I could just pretend to
do that tasting you spoke of. How often does this annum
business come around?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>You may draw on the Treasury at your need.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Somebody&#39;s going to wake me up in a minute.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>Do you accept?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Do I accept? It is the opportunity I have been waiting for.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>Then present yourself at the palace ---</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Wait! I have a sudden thought. What is it I have to do for 
all this?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>Oh, a mere detail; you accept the responsibilities of the 
family.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>But suppose I have no family. I can&#39;t guarantee that.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>Not your family. The Governor&#39;s family.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Support the Governor&#39;s family on ten thousand francs per - 
what is it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>Oh no, no! You simply -- You see, if anyone of his family
should commit any crime - er, I mean little discretion -
you answer for it in your person.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>In my person! That&#39;s where the whipping comes in. Thank
you for wasting my time. That&#39;s not the kind of a position
I&#39;m looking for.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Secretary</speaker>
<p>Oh, there&#39;ll be no whipping, I&#39;ll promise you!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Peace, woman. I have made my choice. I see my opportunity! 
I shall be wedded to nothing but the sea!</p></sp>

<sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>And you have none?</p></sp>

</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>
How he is stupid, your friend Pierrot.
</p></sp>

done very awkwardly while RUDOLFO
stands aside beating time)</stage>

</stage>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>Come, dat is better, Signor Pierrot</l>
<l>Take de lady in arms like so?</l>
</lg>
<stage>(Two figures in attempt to embrace,
fall in a heap)</stage>
<lg>
<l>Santa Maria! No! No! No! No!</l>
</lg>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>How! He is crazy, your friend Pierrot!</p></sp>

<stage>(Dance again, ending in a furious
jumble of legs and arms, RUDOLFO
tearing his hair)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>It is alaways the same-a thing! You begin-a to learn-a de 
Marionettes, and you make-a it all the same joke!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>That&#39;s the point, padre mio! All the world&#39;s a joke! Oh,
how I am happy for the first time in my life! I laugh!</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>You are happy because you make-a three men miserable!</p>

<stage>(MARIETTA takes tambourine from wall
and practices throwing and catching
it, dancing gaily about room as he
talks)</stage>

<p>First me! I say to the peoples, my son-a she has returned. 
Then sudden you say -- No more boy&#39;s dress. I want be myself!
Then for me to crack my brain to explain my sudden
daughter!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>A daughter is best, Padre mio! It brings the customers!
Now your theatre is crowded every night. How many costumes
you have rented for the Quadroon Ball? They all come to see
Marietta!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>Then my good-a Capitaine Dick - and Monsieur Etienne, the 
son-a of His Excellency -- Now you flirt with both!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Suddenly pausing in her dancing
about)</stage><p>
Oh, Padre mio - I think I have my song --</p>
<stage>(She sings dream song)</stage>
<lg><l>
&quot;Oh, sweet mystery of life!&quot;</l></lg></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>That song! Make-a me to go crazy!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Oh, but try it. Padre mio -- Maybe you can finish him -- 
Then I love you, oh so desperately -- like fire!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>Santa Maria forbid! We must practice some more with the 
marionettes - stop this talk about a songs.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>I will not practice any more. I am going to rest too -
like-a dez marionettes - they never do no work themselves.
Always somebody have to make them move.</p></sp>

<stage>(She exits. RUDOLFO follows)</stage>

<stage>(Have PREMIER DANCERS enter dressed
as Marionettes and do a dance. After
dance enter)</stage>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(Look about, Sees no one about and
call)</stage><p>
Oh, Marietta.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Enter)</stage><p>Ah, Monsieur, it is more than kind that you should so often 
visit the house of poor Rudolfo and his unworthy daughter.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Come, Mademoiselle, have you not tired of his masquerade?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Masquerade?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>These mean surroundings are not fitting for you!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>I was never so happy -- I mean, I am used to it!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Come - why not announce your rank? You only postpone the
inevitable day. At any moment your father will arrive from
Italy and think how shall we account for your lodging here?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Ha! Ha! When the illustrious, the Count d&#39;Altena arrives,
you will see your mistake. How he will rave! What, this
little brown maid, this child of the people my daughter?&quot;
He will think you are crazy, yes.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Oh well, I know there is no use trying to persuade you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Still you try.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>I give in for the present. I have come for a different 
purpose. I want you to come to the Quadroon Ball tonight.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>But I cannot - I have told you. Captain Dick he say no, it 
is no place for a very good girl like me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Captain Dick knows nothing of our customs. Many of the
finest women in New Orleans will be there -- masked, of
course. So shall you!</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Captain Dick, he is my friend. He say no! It is so naughty, 
that ball, he will not go himself!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Did he say that -- Strange! Adah - my own Adah has deserted  
me tonight to go with him!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>What! Captain Dick will go with Adah? Wait, I will go also.</p>
<stage>(Going towards door L.)</stage>
<p>Yes, I laid down the law to Rudolfo -- and Captain Dick --
I will go --</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>With me!?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Mais non -- with myself! 
<stage>(Exits door L.)</stage></p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(Follows her to door)</stage><p>She is a witch! What puppets we are, the strongest of us 
can be pulled about by a little weak woman like that.</p></sp>

<stage>
No. 11. SONG -- <hi rend="underline">&quot;YOU MARRY A MARIONETTE&quot;</hi>
</stage>
<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(During the song he takes one of the
Marionettes and setting it upon table,
sings to it)</stage>
<stage>
1
</stage>
<lg>
<l>Now why should a man who has courage to face</l>
<l>God, man and the devil, all three,</l>
<l>Give in to a bundle of satin and lace?</l>
<l>The answer is simple as simple can be!</l>
<l>For we men are but puppets, after all</l>
<l>As we laugh or we sigh or we sing:</l>
<l>Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho!</l>
<l>If we creep or we crawl, if we stand or we fall,</l>
<l>You may gamble some woman is pulling the string!</l>
</lg>

<stage>REFRAIN</stage>
<lg>
<l>Oh, a man is a man, do what he can,</l>
<l>Whatever his breed or birth!</l>
<l>And a maid is a maid and she isn&#39;t afraid</l>
<l>Of the biggest man on earth!</l>
<l>So if you&#39;re a fool and expect to rule</l>
<l>The woman you&#39;re planning to get,</l>
<l>Then by the old Harry, be sure when you marry</l>
<l>You marry a Marionette,</l>
<l>My boy,</l>
<l>Yes, marry a Marionette!</l>
</lg></sp>
<pb/>

<stage>(At finish of song, ETIENNE goes to
door R. and starts to exit. ADAH
suddenly confronts him, closing door,
stands with back to it, glaring at
Etienne)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Adah</speaker>
<p>So! You are here again!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(Coolly)</stage>
<p>And you also!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Adah</speaker>
<p>You - you love this girl -- you no longer love me --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Oh come -- come -- Love -- that&#39;s a large word.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Adah</speaker>
<stage>(Moves to L.)</stage>
<p>You have asked her to go to the ball?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(Opening door)</stage><p>
I have! And I told her to come early that she might see the
sale of those slaves who have displeased their master by
boring them with jealousy!!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Adah</speaker>
<p>You dare not sell me!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<stage>(Sarcastically)</stage><p>Sell you! Not while you are so gentle, so sweet, so confiding, 
so trustful! Ha! Ha!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Adah</speaker>
<p>Etienne!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Sell you? My sweet, never jealous companion. Never think
it.</p>
<stage>(Going out door R.)</stage>
<p>Good-bye! Good-bye!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Adah</speaker>
<stage>(Running to window)</stage><p>Etienne! Etienne! 
</p></sp>

<stage>(Buries her head on windowsill)</stage>

<stage>(CAPTAIN DICK enters from curtains,
goes over to door R., look out,
turns to Adah - touches her on shoulder)</stage>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Adah!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Adah</speaker>
<p>Etienne!</p></sp>
<stage>(She turns, grabbing DICK, thinking
it is Etienne)</stage>

<stage>(MARIETTA enters from L.)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Oh - I - don&#39;t let me disturb you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Adah</speaker>
<p>I thought -- Oh -- let me go.</p></sp>

<stage>(ADAH runs out door R. DICK embarrassed)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>She thought I was Monsieur Grandet!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>And I think you are Monsieur Liar!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Don&#39;t be angry.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Angry! Me! I! You may embrace anyone you please. What
is it to me? I am in a beautiful mood. I have much to do
before I prepare myself for the ball!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>You promised me you would not go!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Sarcastically)</stage><p>Me! I disremember! I am so forgetful. I disremember that 
promise.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>But I&#39;m going to hold you to it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Taking feather duster, pushes it
into CAPTAIN DICK&#39;s face)</stage><p>
Now look you, Captain Dick, consider, I have never had one -
what you say - a good time in all my life.</p></sp>
<stage>(She sits on steps)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>It is your own fault. 
</p></sp>
<pb/>
<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>My fault? Santa Maria! In Italy I was banished and sent 
away to a convent to learn to be a lady --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Where you should have stayed.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Oh, my friend. Then you would never have seen me.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I could have survived. Your parents did exactly right. And 
I shall feel relieved when they come for you.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Oh, very well, they will marry me to the old man so old, so 
ugly, with a long beard ---</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>We shall make it a condition of your safe return to France 
that they shall not compel you to marry.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Your condition! Pooh! That&#39;s what they think of conditions.
And you - how will you feel when poor Marietta is married
to the old one with a beard? And no one will find her dream
song. Have you tried it lately, Captain Dick?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I have not given it a single thought!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Goes to stool R.)</stage><p>
He has given it no thought! And this is my friend, my sworn
friend! Monsieur Etienne he try like the mischief - and he
is no friend!</p></sp>

<stage>(Enter RUDOLFO door L)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Ah, Rudolfo!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>Ah, Signor, you come in time. She drive-a me crazy.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>She&#39;d drive anyone crazy.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>How soon-a you think-a they come to take-a her away?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>It will not be long, Rudolfo. </p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Jumps up)</stage><p>What you think? Not long - and they smile. Barbara! Oh -- </p></sp>
<stage>(Sits down and pretends to cry)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<stage>(Goes to Marietta)</stage>
<p>Oh come! Come! I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>Figlio mio, do not-a weep-a.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>No one love me. My padre, he does not love me!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>Oh yes, like-a my soul -- better than my daughters. Yes -- 
when you are good --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>I am always good. I like pulla de marionette-a! I like de
spaghetti, I even like da monk. Not like Rafaelo damn poor
Italiano. Still you do not love me.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>Ah, but yes, I love you!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Capitaine Dick, he does not love me. -- Or do you?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I certainly do not!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Oh terrible - miserable - my friend will not love me! 
<stage>(Pretending to cry)</stage></p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I like you -- I like you very much.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Jumping up suddenly)</stage><p>Like - ah, miserable -- you like potatoes!</p></sp> 
<stage>(Xes up to L)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<stage>(Following Marietta)</stage><p>Come, come, Marietta, don&#39;t cry, I&#39;ll try to - to more than 
like you!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>He will try! Oh, poor Marietta, he cannot love me, but he
will try --</p></sp>
<stage>(Peeping to see affect)</stage>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>If you&#39;ll stop crying, I&#39;ll do anything.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marieta</speaker>
<p>Oh! He won&#39;t give me one friendly little kiss. Oh - oh --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I will if I must. </p></sp>
<stage>(Puts arms about her to kiss her)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Jumping away and laughing in his
face)</stage><p>
Ha! Ha! Ha! Not tonight, my friend. Oh, you big stupid!
Save your kisses for Adah!</p></sp>
<stage>(Exits door L)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<stage>(Watching after her. Turns angrily)</stage>
<p>It&#39;s your fault, you spoil her.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>But -- but --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>She should have been put in the care of the nuns. I have 
made a mistake allowing her freedom.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>I told you!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<stage>(Very angry)</stage><p>
You did not, no one told me. Besides how can one cage fire
or quicksilver! She - is -- oh, how glad I will be when her
parents come for her.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<stage>(Sadly)</stage>
<p>I cannot be glad, if they take her away - I --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Take her away! Oh well, it must be! And look you, Rudolfo, 
we are responsible for her. She must not go to the ball tonight.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>But certainly, I lock her up tight.</p></sp>

<stage>(MARIETTA seen listening from curtains)</stage>
<pb/>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Lock her up? Poor child - but this is her own fault -- yes,
it must be --</p></sp>
<stage>(Goes towards door R)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>My daughter shall take away everything -- all her clothes. 
We will keep her safe.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>You will be well rewarded, Rudolfo, you shall see!</p></sp>

<stage>(Goes out door R., followed by
RUDOLFO)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Enters from behind curtains)</stage><p>
Lock me up! Oh, the miserable! No, no, if he have spoke
nice, maybe then I not go. But lock me up! Right away --
quick I go!</p>
<stage>(Goes to Marionette platform)</stage>
<p>Come, Pierrot! You shall aid me. La - la - la!</p>
<stage>(She draws curtains)</stage>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<stage>(Coming in)</stage>
<p>Never fear, Captain Dick, I&#39;ll keep her safe for you.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<stage>(Outside)</stage><p> 
Not for me, stupid!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Rudolfo</speaker>
<p>Oh no, for her father!</p>
<stage>(Xes to door L., calls)</stage>
<p>Marietta! Marietta!</p>
<stage>(No answer)</stage>
<stage>(Begins to hum dream melody)</stage>
<p>&quot;La! la! la! la!&quot; Oh, the old fool, me!</p>
<stage>(Sees drawn curtain)</stage>
<p>Ah, she hides to tease-a her old padre.</p>
<stage>(Goes over to curtains. Pulls them
aside, looks in)</stage>
<p>Not here! Ah, the window - perhaps!</p>
<stage>(Turns to door L)</stage>
<p>My cloak! My hat!</p>

<stage>(CRAZIELLA brings them)</stage>

<p>I lock all the doors. I go out and search for Marietta at once.</p></sp>
<stage>(He exits hurriedly out of door R.
locks door after him)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Drawing curtains, laughing)</stage><p>
Oh ho! Signor Pierrot! I shall go to the ball! No! But
<pb/>
he will go with Adah!
</p></sp>
<stage>(MARIETTA comes down steps, dances
to door L., finds it locked -- dances
to door R., finds that also locked --
sees window -- goes to window, takes

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>If anyone approaches, whistle.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Oh, I see -- I&#39;m the whistling boy! Looking out for trouble. </p></sp>
<stage>(Goes to landing)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<stage>(Motions to Lizette)</stage>
<p>Sit.</p></sp>

<stage>(LIZETTE is embarrassed, sits on his
lap)</stage>

<stage>(SILAS gives loud whistle -- BOTH
jump)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Pardon! Pardon! I was just trying it!</p>

<stage>(GOVERNOR and LIZETTE sit again --
SILAS whistles)</stage>
<p>
It slipped.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Turn your back!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>I will! I will! Can I hear to look? No!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<stage>(To Lizette)</stage>
<p>I understand you are not what you seem.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>No woman is what she seems, Governor.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Have you proofs of your parentage? </p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Proofs? Of course!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Your illustrious father is a very rich man, I understand.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Well, he has a lot of money back of him. I don&#39;t know 
whether it will ever catch up.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Under the circumstances, of course you cannot marry my 
Whipping Boy.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Not if it pains you, Governor.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>It would pain me very much.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Oh governor.</p></sp>
<stage>(She throws her arms around the
GOVERNOR&#39;s neck)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Wait! Perhaps when your father comes, he will not consent. 
Think of the life I have led.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Well, Governor, you&#39;ve got nothing on me!</p></sp>

<stage>(SILAS has come down from landing and
is listening eagerly)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Eh?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Besides, why should my father come to America?</p></sp>

<stage>(SILAS shows that he is getting
anxious)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>But we have sent for him. He has offered ten thousand francs 
for your return.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Ten thousand francs for my return. That can&#39;t be my father!</p></sp>

<stage>(SILAS whistles furiously to prevent
LIZETTE saying anything more. THEY
turn in astonishment. SIR HARRY
enters and going up to SILAS, slaps
<pb/>
him heavily on the back. SILAS
chokes)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Sir Harry</speaker>
<p>Well, Sir Whipping Boy, how are you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>I - er --</p>
<stage>(Whistles)</stage>
<p>I - I ---</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Mercy! He&#39;s swallowed the whistle.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Give it up - that whistle was solid gold!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Silas</speaker>
<p>Give it up!</p>
<stage>(Whistles -- whistles)</stage>
<p>I wish I could!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Lizette</speaker>
<p>Take him out! Get a pump! He&#39;ll choke!</p></sp>

<stage>(She and SIR HARRY hustle SILAS off
R., whistling furiously)</stage>

<stage>(Enter ETIENNE)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Ah! Father! How does Louisiana&#39;s prospective ruler find 
himself?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>I find myself very uncomfortable. I don&#39;t approve of your 
schemes, and the deeper they go the less I like them.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Oh nonsense! Affairs are progressing finely. You see my
popularity -- &#39;Twill not be long before &#39;twill be quite
safe to declare Louisiana a republic -- we shall rule here.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>But the Governor -- he may bribe your man.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>I&#39;ll swear to the loyalty of my men. The Governor is safe
on the Isle of Pines. My men but await my word to send him
where men tell no tales!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Governor</speaker>
<p>Ssh! I&#39;ll not listen to it! If it comes out all right, I&#39;m
with you -- but -- remember, I don&#39;t commit myself.</p></sp>
<pb/>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Oh, my worthy parent --</p></sp>

<stage>(He laughs as GOVERNOR exits R.)</stage>

<stage>(Enter MARIETTA from ballroom)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Oh Monsieur! I am glad you persuaded me to come. How I have 
laughed and enjoyed myself!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>I have observed you, Mademoiselle, and I apologize for having
disbelieved your statement that you were not the Countessa
d&#39;Altera!
</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Surprised)</stage>
<p>Eh?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>I have seen you tonight - the spirit of the people. No lady
highly born could have entered as you have into our rustic
festivity.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<stage>(Puzzled)</stage>
<p>I don&#39;t know that I like that.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>Oh, believe me, it has rejoiced me, because if you had really
been the Countessa, you would have been far from the reach
of Etienne Grandet, but even I may aspire to the daughter
of Rudolfo!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Indeed! And how about Adah!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Etienne</speaker>
<p>I will sell her tonight, if you will accept my hand and my 
name.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Sell her! No! No!</p></sp>

<stage>(Enter DICK from ballroom)</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Marietta, may I have a word with you please?</p></sp>

<pb/></p></sp>

<stage>(Etienne exits. DICK to Marietta</stage>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>You find it gay this ball, my friend?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Very gay, my friend.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>You find Adah charming, no?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I find her charming, yes!
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Me, I am tired of everything --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Tired?
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>You are changed tonight - you -- I don&#39;t like you any more!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>You have never seemed to like me to any extent, Mademoisselle!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Oh yes. I thought you were a very high character, but you 
are a coquette!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>I -- a coquette?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Yes, I can&#39;t have a friend who is a coquette. You are all
the same gay, like these Creoles. Yes, drink glass after
glass - I saw you --</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>It&#39;s just the spirit of the place, and yet, there&#39;s something 
the matter with me -- for all I seem gay, I can&#39;t feel happy.</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Marietta</speaker>
<p>Me too!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dick</speaker>
<p>Shall I tell you about it?</p></sp>

<l>He wore a nobby purple suit and an eighteen-karat hat,</l>
<l>And the sweet young things they couldn&#39;t resist so</l>
<l>swell a guy as that.</l>
<l>So he used to take a wedding trip most every day or so,</l>
<l>And then he couldn&#39;t handle all the brides that tried to go;</l>
<l>And he used to get ten trading stamps for every bale he got.</l>
<l>He kept the bakers baking and the bakings they could bake</l>
<l>To keep filled the royal pantry with the royal wedding cake;</l>
<l>Of course a king&#39;s the sort of thing &#39;most everyone wants to be.</l>

<l>So he went to all the luncheons and the dinners and the teas,</l>
<l>And everybody said he was the smoothest thing in Greece.</l>
<l>He jollied Mrs. Mercury and Frau Denostheses</l>
<l>And danced a dozen waltzes with Frau Hercules.</l>
<l>The fat girls all took anti-fat, the slim ones anti-slim,</l>
<l>They did the best they all could do to make a hit with him,</l>
