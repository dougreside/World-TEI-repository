<l>		Say goodbye.</l>
<l>	Fragrance distilling</l>
<l>	Willing or unwilling</l>

<l>	'Tis thus we wander dreaming, dreaming

<l>	Mid the flowers

			(Chorus finishes, enter LEANDRO, L.U.E. Spanish 
			Girls come forward and chorus)</stage>
			<pb/>
			<sp><speaker>Leandro</speaker>
		<stage>(C.)</stage>
	<p>You're very troublesome, you girls.  Just the very day that 
	Mr. Gilfain's arriving from his trip to England you're all
	late.  What's the excuse for this?</p></sp>
		<stage>(Girls laugh)</stage>
			<sp><speaker>Inez</speaker><p>We take longer when we expect such a distinguished visitor.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Valleda</speaker><p>I had a couple inches off my skirt.  Late time Mr. Gilfain
	was here he told me he liked to see my pretty ankles.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Leandro</speaker>
		<stage>(Smokes cigarette)</stage>
	<p>I guess you like to please him that way, in any extent.  But
	he's not coming to an anatomical museum.  The world, is waiting
	 for this season's supply of Florodora, our great perfume.
	 We must see that they get it.  Don't chatter to the clerks - 
	 but get to business.</p></sp>
	 	<stage>(Goes right during the following number)</stage>	 	
	 	<stage>(Enter PYM, LANG, SIMS, AEPFEL, SCOTT, and GROGAN
	 	R.3.E.)</stage>
	 		 <sp><speaker>Pym</speaker>
	 	<stage>(To Leandro)</stage>
	<p>Well, Leandro, is everything in order for Mr. Gilfain?</p></sp> 	
	 		 <sp><speaker>Leandro</speaker>
	 	<stage>(Xes R. to C.)</stage>
	<p>Everything in my department.  I can't answer for the office
	 work.</p></sp>	 
	 		<sp><speaker>Pym</speaker><p>Who asked you to?  We attend to that.</p></sp>
	 		<sp><speaker>Leandro</speaker><p>You?  You mean Mr. Abercoed attends to it.</p></sp>
	 		<sp><speaker>Pym</speaker>
	 	<stage>(Good humoredly)</stage>
	 <p>Well he represents Mr. Gilfain, so we do our duty to our
	 employer when we obey Abercoed.</p></sp>
	 	<stage>(Turns a little up stage L.)</stage>
	 	<stage>(Enter ABERCOED L.U.E)</stage>
	 	<pb/>
		<sp>	<speaker>Abercoed</speaker>
		<stage>(Goes C.)</stage>
	<p>Well, boys, is everything all right in the office?</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Pym</speaker><p>Yes sir.  There's a splendid crop of blossoms and a capital
	crop of orders too.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>And Mr. Gilfain will find everything ready for him.  He can 
	prepare the essence of Florodora the minute he arrives.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Clerks</speaker><p>Can we go now --</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>You may go now...</p></sp>
		<stage>(Pym, Sims, Lang and Aelfel and clerks exit R. in 
		office)</stage>
			<sp><speaker>Leandro</speaker>
		<stage>(Xing to L.)</stage>
	<p>I wish I could find out how he makes Florodora.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>None of that.  The secret of preparing Florodora is Mr.
	Gilfain's own.  To try to find out is to try to rob him.
	Have you anything to say to me --</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Leandro</speaker><p>Yes I have.  One of the farm girls neglects her work.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker>
		<stage>(Watching him carefully)</stage>	
	<p>Which one?</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Leandro</speaker><p>The one all of you spoil of course.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker>
		<stage>(Aside)</stage>
	<p>Dolores.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Leandro</speaker><p>First of all Mr. Gilfain says she is not to do more work than 
	she likes.  Then she does none at all and he doubles her wages.
	There's some mystery about that girl.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>Mystery, nonsense.  Mr. Gilfain likes her as we all do, and
	wants to be kind to her, besides what is it you anyway?</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Leandro</speaker><p>Everything.  She is idle and careless, she sets a bad example.
	I can't maintain discipline.</p></sp>
		<stage>(Symphony of Dolores' Song commences)</stage>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>Send the girl to me, I'll talk to her.</p>
		<stage>(Leandro exits R.U.E)</stage>
	<p>I can't allow Leandro to lord it over her.</p></sp>
		<stage>(DOLORES voice is heard off stage -- singing)</stage>
		<stage>(Abercoed exits R.2.E.)</stage>
		<stage>(After song, Dolores goes up L.C.  ABERCOED enters 
		from R.2.)</stage>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>Ah Dolores come here.
		<stage>(E.C.)</stage>
	Leandro has been complaining about you.  He says that you
	don't attend to your work.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Dolores</speaker>
		<stage>(L.C.)</stage>
	<p>Of course I don't - I hate work.  But don't you be angry with 
	me.  Mr. Gilfain never is.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>And he's the master.  So we must all spoil you like he does, 
	I suppose, and follow his lead.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Dolores</speaker>
		<stage>(Xes to L. toying with a flower and drops it)</stage>
	<p>Is it difficult to follow that lead?</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker>
		<stage>(Following her a little)</stage>
	<p>It is difficult not to follow it.</p></sp>
		<stage>(Picks up flower)</stage>
			<sp><speaker>Dolores</speaker><p>
	A man can always get over a little difficulty like that, if 
	he wants to.
	</p>
	</sp><pb/>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>No, not always  -- there may be reasons why he must not - why
	he dare not.
	</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Dolores</speaker>
		<stage>(Goes to him)</stage>
	<p>And have you any such reasons.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>Yes -- one.</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Dolores</speaker><p>I guess it.  You've married already.</p>
		<stage>(Goes L.C.)</stage>
	<p>Most foreigners have wives in their own country.  That's why
	they come abroad.</p></sp>
		<stage>(Xes R.)</stage>
	<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>No, you are wrong, Dolores.  I left my country, quarreled with
	my own people, because I wouldn't marry.</p></sp>
		<sp><speaker>Dolores</speaker>
		<stage>(Xes to)</stage>
	<p>Yes, you.
		<stage>(Comes down)</stage>
			</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
	Because I wouldn't marry a woman I didn't love.
		<stage>(Xes to L.C.)</stage>
			</p></sp>
			<sp><speaker>Dolores</speaker>
		<stage>(Xes to R.C.)</stage>
	<p>I like you for that.  And you will only marry a woman you 
	really love?
			</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
	Marry?  I mustn't marry - at least, not yet.
			</p></sp><sp><speaker>Dolores</speaker><p>
	Well, if you mustn't marry, that needn't prevent you being 
	in love.
			</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
	No, and Dolores, perhaps I'm in love.
			</p></sp><sp><speaker>Dolores</speaker><p>
		<stage>(Expectantly)</stage>
	With me -- are you in love with me.
	<pb/>
			</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
	Well I mustn't say with whom, but I am in love with somebody.
	Some day I may be free, and I promise to tell you all about 
	it then.
			</p></sp><sp><speaker>Dolores</speaker><p>
	I shall remember that promise.
			</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
	And I will seal it.</p>

		Oh thank you very much.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedlepunch</speaker><p>
		You are not superstitious if you are we won't make it a

				</p></sp>	<sp><speaker>Calista</speaker><p>
		Yes but I haven't anything less than a dollar.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedlepunch</speaker><p>

		Are you aware sir that Str-Angers are not allowed on this island?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedlepunch</speaker><p>
		Quite so, but my mission here is private.  Can you tell me

		</p>

				<sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		No such person known here.  We are expecting the owner of the

		he can inform you.  Are you acquainted with Mr. Gilfain?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedlepunch</speaker><p>
		Yes, that is - I have never met him.
			<stage>(Aside)</stage>
		The villain - it was he who robbed my old friend Quisara

				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Mr. Gilfain is the Supreme authority here.  I must detain you

				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedlepunch</speaker><p>
		Fate?  My word... There'll be something doing here.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Leandro</speaker><p>
		Hadn't I better stab him and throw him into the sea at once.
		What's the use of bothering Mr. Gilfain.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedlepunch</speaker><p>
		That young man is too nervous to be trusted with a knife.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		No - take him away and confine him in the flower shed until

				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		Isn't it?  But Wales is no place for poetry.  England's the

		poet lariat.  He's got a contract by the year with the Government

				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Yes -- where I hoped that none of my acquaintances in England 
		should ever find me.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		Oh you are very polite -- of course, we know that you had 
		disappeared.  We read it in the Daily Telegraph -- but no
		one know why you went or where you'd gone.  Some said you had
		run away, with a French Ballet girl - others, that you were 
		in a lunatic asylum.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
			<stage>(C.)</stage>
		No, neither.  I left England because I'd a promise I couldn't

				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		How noble.  Who was the promise to -- a woman, or a money 
		lender?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Didn't you know I was engaged to marry?
			<stage>(Whispers to her)</stage>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		Yes, I remember.  Well, why didn't you marry her?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Well I didn't love her and like a coward I ran away.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		A coward -- to run away from a woman with $10,000 a year!
		I call it pluck or folly, the same thing.  But she consoled 
		herself.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		How?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		Married soon afterward.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
			<stage>(Eagerly)</stage>

				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Then I'm free -
			<stage>(Xes)</stage>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>

		They all have ties they can't shake off.  Married women are 
		the only people that seem to be really free.
			<stage>(Taps him -- goes to him)</stage>
		But what have you been doing with yourself all this time.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		I went to America to earn my living.  I called at Mr. Gilfain's
		office and told him I wanted a position - he asked 
		me what I could do.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		I suppose you told him you could play bridge.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		No I told him I could read, write, and add up figures.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		Unusual accomplishment for an English gentleman.  Wasn't he 
		surprised.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Now he told me to sit on a high stool - I sat there a year 
		and then he sent me here as his representative, and here I am.
		<pb/>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		Yes here you are right enough, but you can't stop here forever 
		now that you're Lord Abercoed.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Lord Abercoed.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		Don't you know?  Your uncle's been dead ever so long.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Dead?  My uncle dead -- are you certain?
			<stage>(Xes to L.C.)</stage>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
			<stage>(Xes R.)</stage>
		Well reasonably so -- I attended his funeral.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Then I am Lord Abercoed.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		Yes, and you're wanted in England at once.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		I shan't go.  I can be happy enough here.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		What stay here?
			<stage>(Up stage)</stage>
		In this outlandish hole?  Ah there must be some special
		attraction.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Well, I'm free now - and there is -
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		In love, eh?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Yes --
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
			<stage>(R.)</stage>
		How nice, oh do tell me about it.  Are you in love like a 
		common person with a nice girl -- or like a fashionable man 
		with a friend's wife?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		But what brought you here.
		<pb/>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		Oh, I came with Mr. Gilfain on business.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Business.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		Yes, you see, in the first place, I am looking for a suitable
		match for my brother Arthur - now - Angela Gilfain will do 
		splendidly, and then as Mr. Gilfain is so very rich, - why I
		might be persuaded to - to - to --
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Oh I see.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		I am so glad you see.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		You want to be the second Mrs. Gilfain?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		Hush, hush.  Nothing is arranged.  Up to now I am faithful 
		to the memory of my first husband.
			<stage>(Aside)</stage>
		It is so easy to be faithful to a man who isn't alive.
			<stage>(Xes L.)</stage>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Abercoed</speaker><p>
		Well, I know you must have had some strong motive for leaving 
		town.  Why London must be like a deserted village without
		Lady Holyrood.
			<stage>(Takes off hat, bows graciously)</stage>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lady H.</speaker><p>
		Oh I suppose they're perfectly wretched without me.  They

				SONG -- LADY HOLYROOD
				"When I Leave Town"
		I'm a lady, don't forget,
		With a sense of etiquette,
		And all I say,
		Is in the Daily Mail next day,
		Dances, Music Hall and plays
		Drawing rooms and smart soirees
		Or Henley, Goodwood and Paree,
		Owe their great success to me.
		<pb/>
				Refrain
		I'm known everywhere
		From Bayswater to Berkeley Square,
		I have a sort of air that positively knocks you down,
		I'm so gay you know,
		On the go, to and fro,
		There's nothing anywhere about,
		When I leave town when I leave town.
				-2-
		If I go to sup or dine,
		I know where to crew the line,
		A smart black frock,
		And always home by 12 o'clock
		I don't pay anything at all,
		Bar a dreadful Sunday call,
		And when my funds are singing low,
		Someone sees to that, you know.

		It is a fortunate thing for you sir, that your knowledge

		Punch - Tweedlepunch - my photograph.
			<stage>(Handing card to Gilfain)</stage>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		That's the fourth photograph you've given me.  Do you 
		take me for an album.
			<stage>(Throws down picture)</stage>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Oh I say - don't throw them about like that.
			<stage>(Picking up picture)</stage>
		They cost me a cent and a half a piece.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		Do you mean to tell me that by the bumps on the head you 
		can tell which person should marry.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
			<stage>(Xing R)</stage>
		I do - unless its subject has been married before, in 
		which case some of the bumps may not be natural.
			<stage>(GILFAIN Xes L. gets stool comes C)</stage>
		Now it is my theory, that for every woman is born a 
		man is born to match her.
			<stage>(Xing C. with stool, sits)</stage>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p> 
		I know a lot of women who are looking for that man.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		My science saves them the trouble.  Now, for instance, if 
		the count Dr. Castellane has consulted me, I would have 
		married him to Betty Green.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		What a combination!  If you can do all you say, you are
		quite a remarkable man.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
			<stage>(Handle photograph to Gilfain)</stage>
		My dear sir, I should say so --
		<pb/>
			<stage>(Gilfain refuses picture with anger)</stage>
		Excuse me my mistake.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		Now I have a daughter - and I want her to marry if you 
		could find her affinity.
			<stage>(Doubtful)</stage>
		I'd give the world if I could trust you.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Give me <emph rend="underline">half</emph> the world and I'll give you gilt edged security.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		If this scheme of yours is any good I can let you in on a 
		good thing.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Good for you or good for me.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		Good for you, if you succeed.   Now being an American, I
		naturally want my daughter to marry an English Lord.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Quite so.  But where to find a lord in this island, the Lord
		only knows, eh?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		Ah, but there is a Lord?  My head clerk, Abercoed, is really 
		Lord Abercoed.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedlepunch</speaker><p>
		No?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		Yes, he doesn't know that I know it.  Now if science could 
		arrange that my daughter Angela should marry Lord Abercoed,
		I would be very grateful to science.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		And mark your gratitude in a substantial manner.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		Of course.  I'm a man of business.  And science might be 
		induced to do something else.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Science is always open to reason - if there's enough of it.
		Science is golden.
		<pb/>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		I'll give you a chance to make yours 18 K.
			<stage>(Confidentially)</stage>
		Now I have a favorite among my farm girls--
			<stage>(Tweedle bursts out laughing)</stage>
		Are you laughing or crying?  What is the matter with this 
		jackass.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Oh you flirt--
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		First, what do you mean, sir -- she's nothing particular.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
			<stage>(Giggling)</stage>
		Oh of course not.  This is no place for the son of a 
		clergyman.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		And of course a man in my position couldn't marry her of his 
		own accord.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Of course not.  But, if nature had selected her for you,
		you would yield.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		I suppose the terms will be the same in my case as in my 
		daughter's.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Tell me - you see in your case science will have to work 
		over time.  100 for coupling the two couples.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		100 nothing.  I'll give you $10 a head.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Oh no, ten dollars a bump.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		I'll give you fifty dollars a head - take it or leave it?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Well then I'll take it.  But can you make the young people 
		believe in me?  Very few do --
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		They'll do anything I order them - I'm master here.
			<stage>(Broad)</stage>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
			<stage>(Aside)</stage>
		Then every girl on the island will pass through my hands
		and I shall surely find the little Quisara.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		Well then is it a go?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
			<stage>(Shaking hands)</stage>
		It is - the saddest thing in life is forming friendships.
		We meet today and part tomorrow.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		I hope so.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		I beg pardon -- 
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		You heard what I said.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		My mistake, but I should like to cement our friendship 
		before parting, by some little token if you will permit me
		let me see.
			<stage>(Fumbling in pocket)</stage>
		What have I?
			<stage>(Brings out knife)</stage>
		Oh, my pocket knife - now I have carried that knife for 
		ten years - will you accept it?
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		Certainly not.  I wouldn't deprive you of it for the world.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Ah, I see, superstitious.
			<stage>(Coughing)</stage>
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		Well yes, I am - a little.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tweedle</speaker><p>
		Then we won't make it a present.  Just give me something 
		in exchange.  Anything will do.
				</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gilfain</speaker><p>
		I haven't any change.
			<stage>(Hand in pocket bring out bills)</stage>
		Nothing smaller than a $2.00 bill.
