<stage>OPENING CHORUS[: "Election Day"]</stage>



<sp><speaker>CHORUS. </speaker>
<lg>

<l>Election Day, Election Day,</l>

<l>That's the day when everybody's happy,</l>

<l>That's the day when everybody's glad.</l>

<l>Election Day, Election Day,</l>

<l>That's the day when you forget</l>

<l>All the aches and pains you have had.</l>

</lg>
<lg>

<l>You gather at the election polls,</l>

<l>And there you stand in line.</l>

<l>Although the day be dark and cold,</l>

<l>Still you never mind.</l>

<l>You are thinking of the politicians whom last year you trusted,</l>

<l>And when they got into positions, promises they busted.</l>

<l>You will try not make the same mistake&#8212;</l>

<l>This Election Day. Hooray!</l>

<l>Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!</l>
</lg>

</sp>
<stage>(looking to stage right) </stage>

<stage>(Enter supporters of Steve Jenkins right.)</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>JENKINS
SUPPORTERS.</speaker>

<l>We stand for everything that we can get.</l>

<l>Our man is for the country going wet.</l>

<l>We'll bring back the whiskey, beer, and gin.</l>

<l>We know that Steve Jenkins will win.</l>

</sp>

<sp><speaker>CHORUS. </speaker><lg>

<l>The gang of Steve Jenkins, a lame and hungry bunch,</l>

<l>They're going to bring back the five-cent beer and lunch.</l>

<l>If he's elected, it sure will be a sin.</l>

<l>We hope that he'll never, never win.</l>
</lg>
<stage>(following Steve Jenkins supporters as they exit
right)</stage>



<stage>(looking towards left)</stage>
<lg>
<l>Hooray! Hooray!</l>

<l>What crowd is this a-coming . . .</l>

<l>Hooray! Hooray!</l>

<l>With whistling fife and drumming?</l>

<l>Let's clear the way for a great big demonstration.</l>

<l>They will carry the day with a riotous consternation.</l>

</lg>
</sp>
<stage>(Enter left Mrs. Peck and Mr. Peck's supporters. Onions
is one supporter and carries a drum.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>PECK
SUPPORTERS.</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Me, him, and she,</l>

<l>She, him, and me,</l>

<l>We're the ones who will elect</l>

<l>For our Mayor, we will have Sam Peck.</l>

<l>You will agree that me, him, and she</l>

<l>Will take 'em, make 'em, shake 'em, break 'em,</l>

<l>Just we three.</l>

</lg>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CHORUS. </speaker><lg>

<l>Gee, but they are funny,</l>

<l>"She, him, and me."</l>

<l>It's worth lots of money such a sight to see.</l>

<l>Poor Cox's Army ain't</l>

<l>One, two, three.</l>

<l>With a bunch of hecks like old Sam Peck's</l>

<l>"Me, him, and she."</l>
</lg></sp>


<stage>(The two stanzas above repeat. Mrs. Peck and
supporters exit.)</stage>



<stage>(Enter Harry Walton's supporters right.)</stage>


<sp><speaker>HARRY
SUPPORTERS.</speaker>
<lg>

<l>We're for Harry Walton, here we come.</l>

<l>We'll vote for Harry Walton, our favorite son.</l>

<l>And with banners blowing, we will soon be showing</l>

<l>(If we keep step with the <hi rend="underline">hep
hep</hi> and rattle of the drum),</l>

<l>Honor is our motto, bright and grand.</l>

<l>Justice is the platform on which we stand.</l>

<l>And since we are in it, we are going to win it.</l>

<l>Harry Walton is the man.</l>

<l>He is the man for whom we all will
stand.</l>
</lg>
</sp>

<stage>(Mr. Williams appears on hotel step.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>CHORUS.</speaker>
<p> <stage>(addressing
Mr. Williams)</stage> Speech! Speech!</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker><p>
Friends and citizens of Jimtown.&#8212;It is useless for me to attempt to tell
you what kind of a man Harry Walton is and that he <hi rend="underline">is</hi> the right man for the Mayor, for no doubt you all know him as
well as I. In fact, we have watched him grow from boyhood.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>CHORUS.</speaker>
<p> <stage>(interrupting)</stage>
He is the man!</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker>
<stage>(continuing)</stage> <p>His honesty, integrity,
and efficiency make him the logical man for the office, and it is the solemn
duty of each and every citizen of Jimtown to vote for him, for he's all right.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>CITIZEN.</speaker>
<p> What's the matter with Harry Walton?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>CHORUS.</speaker>
<p> He's all right!</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker>
<p> Who's all right?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>CHORUS.</speaker><lg>
<l> Harry Walton's all right! Hooray! Hooray!
Hooray!</l>



<l>We're for Harry Walton, here we come.</l>

<l>We'll vote for Harry Walton, our favorite son.</l>

<l>And with banners blowing, we will soon be showing</l>

<l>(If we keep step with the <hi rend="underline">hep
hep</hi> and rattle of the drum),</l>

<l>Honor is our motto, bright and brand.</l>

<l>Justice is the platform on which we stand.</l>

<l>And since we are in it, we are going to win it,</l>

<l>Harry Walton is the man.</l>

</lg>
</sp>
<stage>(The chorus repeats the stanza above. Dance. The
chorus exits.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>JESSIE.</speaker><stage>(following father center stage)</stage><p> Father,
your speech was brief but to the point, and you are right. Harry is the man.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker><p>
Well, daughter, no doubt some may say that my efforts in his behalf are
prompted by the fact that he is to become my son-in-law, but my only motive is
to see the right man in the right place.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JESSIE.</speaker>
<p> And Harry is the right man.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker><p>
Well <stage>(laugh)</stage>, I trust my daughter is
looking at it through unbiased eyes and not because she is to become the future
Mrs. Harry Walton.</p></sp>



<stage>(Ruth
Little approaches.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>JESSIE.</speaker><stage>(rebuking)
</stage><p>Oh, Father!</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker>
<p> Oh, did I tell on you?</p></sp>


<stage>(He exits slowly into hotel.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>RUTH.</speaker><p> Oh,
I see after Harry is elected there seems to be a certainty that there is going
to be a little wedding.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>JESSIE.</speaker>
<p> Oh, no, Ruth.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>RUTH.</speaker><p> Oh,
that's all right. I have known it right along. But&#8212;<hi rend="underline">(very independently)</hi> none of that wedding stuff for me, kid.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JESSIE.</speaker>
<p> Why not, Ruth?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>RUTH.</speaker>
<p> Because I'm simply too full of jazz.</p></sp>



<stage>(Jessie follows father into the hotel.)</stage>


<stage>SONG: "I'm Simply Full of Jazz"</stage>



<sp><speaker>RUTH.</speaker>
<lg>

<l>Everybody thinks I'm crazy.</l>

<l>They say I've gone plum mad.</l>

<l>Everybody thinks I'm crazy,</l>

<l>Lost all the sense I ever had.</l>

</lg>
<lg>

<l>When they see me shake, it makes them shiver.</l>

<l>When I do a break, it makes them quiver.</l>

<l>But I'm not insane. I'm not to blame.</l>

<l>The cause of it all isn't in my brain.</l>

</lg>

<stage>(Jazz Jasmines enter and assist in song and
dance.)</stage>

<lg>

<l>Just because I like to do a wiggle</l>

<l>In a regular Salome style,</l>

<l>Just because I like to do a li'l wriggle,</l>

<l>Like on the Hawaiian isle . . .</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>'Cause I kick like a donkey, jump way back,</l>

<l>'Cause I act like a money, and ball the jack,</l>

<l>And like Miss Minnie, I do the shimmy,</l>

<l>Keep my shoulders shaking until you hear them crack . . .</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Just 'cause you see my feet
a-shufflin'</l>

<l>Just because I act like a razz,</l>

<l>'Cause I seem a little hazy, I ain't crazy.</l>

<l>I'm just full of jazz, jazz, jazz,</l>

<l>Simply full of jazz.</l>
</lg></sp>


<stage>(Enter right Harry Walton followed by Onions. Mr.
Williams appears on hotel step.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>ONIONS.</speaker>
<p> I want to see you.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON.</speaker>
<p> <stage>(stopping
short center stage)</stage> What do you want? </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ONIONS.</speaker><p> What
I want to explain to you is&#8212;that simply because I happen to be working
for Jenkins and Peck in that grocery store&#8212;ain't no sign that I got to
vote for neither of them.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON.</speaker>
<p> What can I do about that?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS. </speaker><stage>(interrupting)</stage><p>Just a moment, Harry. Possibly I can enlighten
the gentleman.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON.</speaker>
<p> I hope you can.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>ONIONS.</speaker>
<p> Proceed with the illumination.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS. </speaker><p>A
vote, my friend, is every citizen's sacred right and should be cast
conscientiously using, of course, your best judgment as to the man who stands
for the best principle.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON.</speaker>
<p> Exactly.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>ONIONS.</speaker>
<p> And for the one that we feels is to benefit us
the most.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker>
<p> Why certainly.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>ONIONS.</speaker>
<p> <stage>(to
Harry)</stage> There you is. I knows you heard dat.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON.</speaker>
<p> Why of course I heard that.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>ONIONS.</speaker>
<p> Well, I figgers that for $5.00 you is the best
man.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON.</speaker><stage>(perplexed)</stage><p>What do you mean?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>ONIONS.</speaker><p> Well
to make it plain, if you give me $5.00, I knows you is the best man. Therefore,
I votes for you. You can't beat that.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON.</speaker>
<p> I don't care for your kind of a vote. Thank
you.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>ONIONS. </speaker><stage>(picking up basket and making hasty exit to
hotel)</stage><p>I done asked that man
for too much money. I can see dat right now.</p> <stage>(meets Jessie on step)</stage></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker>
<p> Harry, how is the election coming along?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON.</speaker>
<p> Glad to say it is coming along quite well.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker><p>
That's fine and dandy. My boy, it behooves you to win, for if you are beaten by
either of those ignoramuses, Steve Jenkins or Sam Peck, who would run our town
just as they run their grocery store, I shall never consent to you becoming my
son-in-law.</p></sp>

<stage>(Jessie listening.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON.</speaker>
<stage>(reproachfully)</stage><p>Why, Mr. Williams!</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker><stage>(walking
to hotel)</stage><p> That's final. <stage>(goes into hotel)</stage></p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JESSIE.</speaker><stage>(making
sure father has gone, then crossing to Harry)</stage><p>&#8212;Harry, you can't lose. Jenkins or Peck beating you, why the
idea is absurd.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON.</speaker><stage>(down-heartedly)
</stage><p>I know, Jessie, but suppose .
. .</p></sp>



<stage>SONG: "Love Will Find a Way"</stage>


<sp><speaker>JESSIE</speaker>
<lg>

<l>Come, dear, and don't let our faith weaken.</l>

<l>Let's keep our love fires burning bright.</l>

</lg>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON.</speaker><lg>

<l>Your love for me is heav'nly beacon,</l>

<l>Guiding me through love's darkest night.</l>

</lg></sp>

<sp><speaker>JESSIE</speaker>
<lg>

<l>Don't start minding or fault-finding,</l>

<l>No matter how dark one's path may grow.</l>

</lg></sp>

<sp><speaker>HARRY WALTON</speaker>
<lg>

<l>Fate won't hurry. Well, don't worry.</l>

<l>We'll just keep our hearts aglow.</l>

</lg></sp>

<sp><speaker>BOTH</speaker>
<lg>

<l>Love will find a way, though skies now are gray.</l>

<l>Love like ours can never be ruled.</l>

<l>Cupid's not schooled that way.</l>

<l>Dry each tear-dimmed eye.</l>

<l>Clouds will soon roll by.</l>

<l>Though fate may lead us astray,</l>

<l>My dearie, mark what I say:</l>

<l>Love will find a way.</l>

</lg></sp>

<stage>(They repeat the chorus and exit right.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> Good morning, Mrs. Peck.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker>
<p> Good morning.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> Have you any influence over your husband at
all?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker>
<p> Why, of course. I am his wife.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> Why don't you get him to withdraw from this
race then?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker>
<p> I will have him withdraw only on one
condition.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> And what's that?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker>
<p> And that is if Steve Jenkins does.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><stage>(annoyed
and excited)</stage><p> Now ain't that
ridiculous? Steve Jenkins was nominated by the political machine, and your
husband Sam Peck is running on an independent ticket. Can you beat that? An
independent ticket.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker>
<p> Oh, well my husband was always independent.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Well, I know, but it looks to me that he would help Steve Jenkins to win inasmuch
as they are partners in Jimtown's most prosperous store.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker>
<p> No, jest "store." Not "prosperous."</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><stage>(pleading)</stage><p>Well, can't you see he is only splitting the
ticket, and he hasn't got a chance to win? So why don't you get him to give up?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker>
<p> I don't want him to give up.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> And why not?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker><stage>(proudly)
</stage><p>Because if he is elected, then
I would be the First Lady of the town.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Oh, I thought there was a catch to it. Well, don't worry. He will never be
elected.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker>
<stage>(loudly)</stage>
 <p>And why not?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Because Tom Sharper is the political boss of Jimtown, and <hi rend="underline">my</hi> candidate, Steve Jenkins, will be the next Mayor.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker><stage>(emphatically)</stage><p>&#8212;Never. You have asked me two or three
times to have my husband withdraw, but I'll wager you never asked Mr. Walton to
do so.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> Oh, that lovesick bird. He is the least of my
worries.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker>
<p> I suppose so.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>UNCLE NED.</speaker><stage>(emerges
from hotel)</stage><p> Good morning,
Sister Peck.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>MRS. PECK.</speaker>
<p> Good morning, Uncle Ned.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>UNCLE NED.</speaker>
<p> You sure looks like a flapper this morning.</p></sp>



<stage>(Mrs. Peck snickers and exits right.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> Good morning, Uncle Ned. How are you feeling
this morning?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>UNCLE NED.</speaker>
<p> Oh, jes' tol'ble.&#8212;Jes' tol'ble.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> I'm glad to hear that. How are you figuring on
voting?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>UNCLE NED.</speaker>
<p> Well, not for Steve Jenkins or Sam Peck.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER</speaker>
<p>. Sam Peck is out of the question. But why not
for Steve Jenkins?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>UNCLE NED.</speaker><p>
'Cos every time I goes into dat grocery store, one of dem low-lifed rascals
tries to rob me. Dey ain't got no chance of gitting elected nohow. No more
chance den a one-legged man has in a kicking match and someone done stole bof' his
crutches.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Well now, Uncle Ned, I am really sorry to hear you say that, because I figured
that an old village patriot of your standing, your vote would be worth just a
brand new $10 bill. <stage>(showing money)</stage></p></sp>



<sp><speaker>UNCLE NED.</speaker><p>
Oh, dat's diff'rent <stage>(taking bill)</stage>&#8212;dat's
diff'rent.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> That's what I thought.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>UNCLE NED.</speaker>
<p> Whyn't you axe me dat at first? <stage>(walks away)</stage></p>
</sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> Don't forget now. Steve Jenkins to win.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>UNCLE NED.</speaker>
<p> Fergit? <stage>(looking
at money)</stage> How's I'm gwine to fergit son? <stage>(pauses&#8212;and turns back) </stage>Look here, Tom.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> What's the matter now?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>UNCLE NED.</speaker><p>
Take dis here money right straight back, boy. I never sold a vote in my life. I
come up in dem good old bandana days when honesty was the best policy.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> Bandana days?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>UNCLE NED.</speaker>
<p> Dat's what I said.</p></sp>


<stage>SONG: "Bandana Days"</stage>



<sp><speaker>UNCLE NED and TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<lg>

<l>Why, the dearest days of my life were bandana days,</l>

<l>Bandana days, though filled with turmoil, trouble, and strife.</l>

<l>Dearest mem'ries will live always. . . .</l>

</lg>
<lg>

<l>In those dear old bandana days,</l>

<l>Cane-and-cotton-ne'er-forgotten bandana days . . .</l>

<l>And in those quaint old bandana ways,</l>

<l>When our dads were courting our dear mammies,</l>

<l>They were sure some bashful sammies . . .</l>

</lg>
<lg>

<l>And in all their bandana plays:</l>

<l>Banjos strummin', they'd be hummin' bandana lays,</l>

<l>And in the pale moonlight</l>

<l>They'd swing left and right</l>

<l>In those dear old bandana days.</l>

</lg>
</sp>

<stage>(Enter Sam Peck and Steve Jenkins from right
having a heavy argument. Sam carries a soapbox.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
<p> I don't want to hear dat now.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
I'm a man what knows everything. You ain't got no business being no Mayor, and
you knows you ain't. What you talking about, being Mayors&#8212;?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker><stage>(interrupting)</stage><p>I got jes' as much right to be Mayors of
Jimtown as you is&#8212;and&#8212;mucher 'fers that's recerned. What you
talkin' 'bout, I ain't got no right to be Mayors of Jimtown?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><stage>(loudly)</stage><p>It takes brains to be a Mayor. You ain't got
brains enough to have a decent headache. You jes' runnin' against me 'cos you
jealous of me&#8212;dat's all you is. Me en' you runnin' a grocery store
togeder, too. Minute you think I got a chance of gitting elected, you splits
the ticket. Dat's what I git fer taking you in the grocery store as my partner.
Ought never to have taken you in der in the first place.<stage> (crosses left)</stage></p>

</sp>
<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
<p> <stage>(following)</stage>
Now here listen. Wait a minute. Lemme git you straightened out about dat der

<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
<p> Well, I mout a good deal more.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>

<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
<p> Yes, I mout. <hi rend="underline">(loudly)&#8212;</hi>Don't tell me I moutn't. But when it comes to
politics, that's where the friendship ceases, right der and den. And den here's
another thing.&#8212;I ain't gwine to let you run for Mayors of Jimtown, and I
be's the common folks. So git dat right out of yo' haid while you is at it. <stage>(crosses right)</stage></p>
</sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(following)
</stage><p>There you goes talkin' like
dat. I tol' you when I first started runnin'&#8212;I sez,&#8212;Sam, if I gits
elected Mayors of Jimtown, I'm gwine to make you the Vice Mayor.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>

surprise)</stage> The Vice Mayor???????</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> Sure, it's a good job for you.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker><p>
Why don't you offer me a job that amounts to something? The Governor of the
County or something like dat. What kin I do with the Vice Mayor's job?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
To show you dat you ain't got no business bein' nothing. You ain't even voted
for yourself yet.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
<p> I can't vote for myself.</p></sp>

<stage>SONG: "Uncle Tom and Old Black Joe"</stage>

<note>[may have appeared in Act 2,
directly following "If You Haven't Been Vamped by a Brownskin"]</note>



<sp><speaker>UNCLE TOM and OLD BLACK JOE.</speaker>
<lg>

<l>I'm Uncle Tom, and I'm Old Black Joe.</l>

<l>I came up from the time long ago.</l>

<l>My name's in history. Everyone sings of me.</l>

<l>Though three score and twenty, we have pep aplenty.</l>

<l>Now we are going right down to the square,</l>

<l>And we will be showing the Mayor</l>

<l>Where he shall start to build a City Hall</l>

<l>And tell him when we're coming to call.</l>

</lg>
<lg>

<l>We are electioneers, Jimtown electioneers,</l>

<l>And since '61, Old Black Joe and Uncle Tom,</l>

<l>At election time, whether rain or shine:</l>

<l>We're
down at the polls when they call the roll;</l>

<l>We
have elected every president since '63;</l>

<l>The
last one that we elected was old Booker T.</l>

<l>If you want to know who makes Jimtown go,</l>

<l>It's Uncle Tom and Old Black Joe.</l>
</lg>
</sp>


<stage>(Dance. Exit left. Enter Steve from right,
dejected looking, followed by Tom.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Ain't you a fine candidate for Mayor? I spend one half the morning trying to
get that crowd together and the other half walking them up one street and down
the other to find you to make a speech, and when you get to the most important
part of it, you do a bonehead trick like that.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
Looka here, Tom, I wonder if dat was baked or fricasee'd chicken what he had on
dat tray. Did you notice?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Listen here, Steve, do you know this is Election Day and you are running for Mayor?
Do you realize that?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> 'Course I know. What you always asking me dat
for?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Because at the last minute you followed a tray full of food round here and lose
those votes when I told you you needed them.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
Looka here, Tom. Ain't Sam runnin' for Mayor same as I is? Didn't he follow dat
man same as I did? What you talking about?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> I know, but you can't compare yourself to Sam.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
How come I can't? We're partners runnin' a grocery store together, ain't we?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
I know, but Sam is spending twice as much money in this election as you&#8212;</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> Spending twice as much money???</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER. &#8212;</speaker>
<p>Yes, and he's away ahead of you.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(questioningly)
</stage><p>I wonder where he's gittin' the
money from??</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Didn't you just say that you and Sam were partners in the same grocery store?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(pondering)</stage><p>&#8212;Yes, and that's jes' what I am thinking 'bout,
too. We're partners.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER. </speaker>
<p>And your profits are the same?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> Well, dey ought to be. Mebbe dey ain't.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Yet you wonder why he's got twice as much money to spend as you?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
See here, Tom, you don't mean Sam is stealing from me. Do you?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Yes. That's just what he is doing, and he has been stealing from you ever since
you have been in business with him.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
<stage>(rather puzzled)</stage> What am I gwine to
do about it?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> I have taken matters in my own hand.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(rejoicing)
</stage><p>Well I'm glad of dat, 'cos you
kin catch him. I can't. You is slicker den I is.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Quite right. I have sent to New York for Keeneye, that great colored detective.
You jes' leave Sam to me. I'll fix him.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(disappointedly)
</stage><p>No, no. If you done sent for a
retective, you is gwine to fix me. Dat's what you're gwine to do.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> <stage>(impatiently)</stage>
Listen, Steve, you don't understand.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
I understands better 'n you do. You is the man what don't understand. I
understands flooencly myself.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> Ain't there stealing going on in the store?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(drawing
it out) </stage><p>Y&#8211;e&#8211;s, and
he'll come down here and catch the wrong stealer. That man ain't gwine to come
down here and jes' watch Sam. He is gwine to lock up the first man he catches
stealin'.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> Why, of course.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> Well, I can't take no chances like dat, Tom.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> You can't???</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> No, no, no.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Say, listen Steve, I am hiring this detective to watch Sam, not to watch you.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(rejoicing)
</stage><p>Oh, he is gwine to watch the man
what you wants him to watch.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Why, of course. Ain't he our detective? But listen, its going to take plenty of
money to do this thing.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
Well, if he comes down here and watches Sam and keeps his eyes off me, you can
have all the money you want.</p></sp>



<stage>(Three groups of two boys each enter from opposite
sides, meet, and listen to the conversation.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> Fine. That's all I want to hear you say.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
All I want you to do is to git me elected, and if you do, I'm gwine to dance at
your wedding.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> And there's going to be a wedding, just as
soon as you are elected.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(surprised)</stage><p>Looka here, Tom. Who are you gwine to marry?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> Why, Emaline!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
<p> Well, wait on him.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> I waited on the last customer what come in

<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
<p> I waited on the last customer myself.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> Don't tell me. I waited on the last customer.</p></sp>



<stage>(Customer growing more impatient.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker><p>
I knows who I waits on and whose I don't. What's the matter wid you? You must
be losing your mind, ain't you? What do you think I am in de store for if I
don't knows who I waits on. You make a man mad wid arguing like dat.&#8212;What
was the last thing what was sold in here, anyhow?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> Huh?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
<p> I say, what was the last thing that was sold
in here?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
Dat shows what you know about it. We didn't have the last thing what was sold
in here.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker><p>
Well I jes' lit my pipe, and I ain't gwine to quit smoking to wait on nobody.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>

and git five pounds of meal. Man wants meal, git meal. Come in here arguing 'bout
dat old five pounds of meal . . .</p></sp>



<stage>(Customer stoops to get meal.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker><p>
Yes,&#8212;and a man what comes in here and wants all the waiting-on he wants
ought to come in when we're standing up.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> <stage>(looking
at man who is still scooping meal)</stage> Heah, heah, mister. Straighten up der
sometime. What's the matter wid you? Man sends you in der for five pounds of
meal, and you gits five tons of it. Come on round from der anyhow. Where you
git dat? Come in here and take all the meal we got.</p>



<stage>(Customer approaches with a tremendous bag of
flour. Steve eyes it.)</stage>

<p>

<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker><stage>(looking
at bag) </stage><p>Well, he ain't missed
it much.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>

de scales over der. <stage>(customer goes in
wrong direction)</stage>&#8212;<hi rend="underline">I said de
scales</hi> are over <hi rend="underline">der</hi>. <hi rend="underline">No</hi>, not up der. You is the dummest
customer ever I saw in my life.</p>


<stage>(Customer finds scales and weighs meal.)</stage>

<p>

<sp><speaker>CUSTOMER.</speaker>
<p> Five pounds exactly.</p></sp>

<p> Well, all you got to do is pay for it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CUSTOMER.</speaker>
<p> Yes, but I'm not the porter 'round here.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>

<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> Yeh, but you ain't seen the lady.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> <stage>(disgustedly)</stage>
What's that got to do with it? Leave that to common folks and errand boys,
not for big men like you.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> <stage>(conceitedly)</stage>
Say, I is a big man, ain't I? <stage>(to
Sam)</stage> Go on take it up der.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>

<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker><stage>(escorting
her to door) </stage><p>Yeh, honey. </p><stage>(waves goodbye, returns and goes to
telephone, right)</stage><p> Hello!&#8212;Hello!</p></sp>



<stage>(Tom and Steve go to cash register. Tom stands at
counter, and Steve opens register just as Tom throws can of baking powder to
floor. Sam looks around for cause of the confusion. Steve passes money to Tom.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker>
<p> Say, I want you to buy some votes with dat
money. Do you hear?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker>
<p> You don't doubt me? Do you?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
Well, I can't say that I doubts you, but as much money as I done give you, I
ought to be elected four times before now.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>TOM SHARPER.</speaker><p>
Now listen here, Steve. To prove to you that I'm on the level, I am going to

And you is on the right grounds, 'cos all de stealin' dat is gwine on, is gwine

partner stealin'. Catch him wid de goods on him so that I kin rescuse him.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE.</speaker>
<p> I suppose he is in your way.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
<p> Well relittically speakin'&#8212;yes.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE.</speaker><p>
You know, Mr. Peck, it is always customary to pay something in advance in all
professional engagements of this kind.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
<p> Yes, naturally I knows dat. Now, how much does
you want for dis case.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE.</speaker><p>
As this is a very important case, I should judge about $100 ought to take care

<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
 <stage>(surprised)</stage>
<p>$100 ought to take care of you <hi rend="underline">and</hi> de case!</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE.</speaker>
<p> Well, that is very reasonable, sir.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker><p>
Yes, you is right. And it is worth every penny of it if you catch my partner
stealin'.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE. </speaker>
<p>Worth every penny of it.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>

<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE.</speaker>

<stage>(Mr. Penrose shuts register, and Steve, hearing
the bang, turns around.)</stage>

<p>
Say, you didn't see Sam come back in here, did you?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE.</speaker>
<p> No, I didn't.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>
You ain't wid de cashmere people of Chicago like you said, is you?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE.</speaker>
<p> No. I just said that to throw your partner
off.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(rejoicing)</stage><p>I'm sure glad he don't know who you is, 'cos
you never would catch him if he did. You know he is kind of sly.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE.</speaker><p>
I received Tom Sharper's letter, so here I am on the grounds, ready for

<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><p>

<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(covering
combination with hat) </stage><p>But that
ain't none of your business. You are not here to watch me. You are here to

<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker><stage>(indignantly)</stage><p>Oh, dry up, young man. Dry right up. Don't you
try to tell me my business. I'm one of the oldest citizens of Jimtown, a
taxpayer, and have a perfect right to know why the city's money is being so
foolishly spent. Who in the world ever heard of a city paying for the Mayor's
valet? What right have we to pay for these five stenographers? And look at this
office. Look at this office! <stage>(stamps foot
impatiently)</stage> Does it <hi rend="underline">look</hi> like a
Mayor's office? I should say not. It looks like some old woman's home!</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE. </speaker><p>But,
you must admit, Mr. Williams, that the Mayor has some very beautiful
stenographers.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS. </speaker><p>Beautiful
and minus ability. Why, every one of them would have to have their fingers cut
off before they could write shorthand. Steve Jenkins, a Mayor. He's no Mayor.
He's a nightmare. See here, he hasn't been elected Mayor three days when he's
bought an automobile, engaged six chauffeurs, and we, <hi rend="underline">we</hi>, the city have got to pay for it.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE. </speaker><p>I
don't blame you, Mr. Williams, for thinking that way. The whole election is a
fraud. At the right time and at the right place I will prove to the whole of
Jimtown that Harry Walton is the rightful mayor.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS.</speaker>
<p> <hi rend="underline">You</hi> will
prove it? And who are you?</p>



<stage>(Detective shows badge.)</stage>

<p>>Oh, I see.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE. </speaker><p>My
position here is a very peculiar one. Tom Sharper hired me to watch Sam Peck.
Mrs. Peck hired me to watch Steve Jenkins. And when I got here, I found them
robbing each other, and worst of all, my best friend Harry Walton being
cheated.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS. </speaker>
<p>Cheated?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>JACK PENROSE. </speaker><p>Yes,
cheated. As I said before, at the right time and at the right place I will
expose all. For the present, we better not be seen together. I would advise
that you leave the office at once and leave everything in my hands.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>JIM WILLIAMS. </speaker><p>I
guess you are right, Mr. Penrose, for I don't care to come in contact with
Steve Jenkins to begin with. Steve Jenkins, the Mayor of Jimtown! Some joke. <stage>(exits left indignantly, banging door)</stage></p></sp>



<sp><speaker>DETECTIVE. </speaker>
<p>Good morning, Miss Secretary.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SECRETARY TO MAYOR. </speaker>
<p>Good morning, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SECRETARY TO MAYOR. </speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, sir, and there's one very important letter this morning.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Important letter?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SECRETARY TO MAYOR. </speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, sir, your honor.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SECRETARY TO MAYOR. </speaker>
<p>The President.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Oh, you mean Warren. Yes, yes, yes. What did he
have to say?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SECRETARY TO MAYOR. </speaker>
<p>He wants to make a speech here one night next
week.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Wants to make a speech here one night next
week??</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SECRETARY TO MAYOR. </speaker>
<p>Yes, your honor.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>Now,
let me see. Next week's my busy week. I can't see him.&#8212;Any more mail?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SECRETARY TO MAYOR. </speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, sir. There's a lot of mail this
morning.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Did you read it yet?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SECRETARY TO MAYOR. </speaker>
<p>Not yet, sir.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>That's
strange. Take the stenographers to the next office. Have them answer it. The
Mayor don't care to be resturbed.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SECRETARY TO MAYOR. </speaker>
<p>Attention.</p>



<stage>(Stenographers stand at attention.)</stage>

<p>>Forward march. Halt. Right
flank march.</p></sp>



<stage>(Stenographers and secretary exit right. Steve walks
around office, scratches his head, brings chair center, then replaces chair.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>Onions!</stage><p></p></sp>



<sp><speaker>ONIONS. </speaker>
<p>Yes, sir.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Bring me that chair.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>ONIONS. </speaker>
<p>Now, you will find the chair right over there.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>I

is. You understand? Bring the chair <hi rend="underline">here</hi>.</p>


<stage>(Onions brings chair center.)</stage>

<p>Now be went. Get to wenting.</p></sp>



<stage>(Onions exits right, and Steve deliberately replaces
chair to its first position.)</stage>



<sp><speaker>MAYOR'S DOORMAN. </speaker>
<p>Chief of Police to see you, sir.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(excitedly)</stage><p>Huh?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MAYOR'S DOORMAN. </speaker>
<p>Chief of Police to see you.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Chief of Police to see me?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>MAYOR'S DOORMAN. </speaker>
<p>Yes, sir.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Did he have any papers in his hand?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>MAYOR'S DOORMAN. </speaker>
<p>Yes, sir.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(growing
more excited) </stage><p>Did you tell him
I was here?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>MAYOR'S DOORMAN. </speaker>
<p>Yes, sir.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>What
did you want to do that for? You had no business telling that Chief of Police I
was here. Why didn't you come in here and axe me if I was here or not? <stage>(walking up and down)</stage> Where is he? Out
there at the front door?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>MAYOR'S DOORMAN. </speaker>
<p>Yes sir.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(frightened)
</stage><p>He's liable to be 'round at
the back door now. I don't know how to get out of here. What did you want to
tell him I was here for anyhow?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>MAYOR'S DOORMAN. </speaker>
<p>He said he wanted to see the Mayor.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Said he wanted to see who?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>MAYOR'S DOORMAN. </speaker>

<p>Yes, sir.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(independently)
</stage><p>Tell him to come in here. What

<sp><speaker>MAYOR'S DOORMAN. </speaker>
<p>This way, officer. His Honor the Mayor.</p></sp>


<stage>(Sam enters as Chief of Police.)</stage>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Well, well, it dooz me proud, it dooz me proud.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Make yourself right at home, Sam.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker><stage>(sitting

<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(sitting
down) </stage><p>Oh, man, I'm the
mayorest Mayor that ever mayored anywhere. Make yourself right at home, Sam.
That's all you got to do. Go ahead and make yourself right at home.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Don't worry about me. I'm all right.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>Der
ain't nothing in here you kin steal. I got these typewriters all counted. <stage>(he counts the four typewriters)</stage> Yes,
there's eight of them. Say, look here, Sam.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Yes?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Is you arrested anybody yet?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker><stage>(slowly)
</stage><p>Now that's what I come down
here to see you about.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(frightened)
</stage><p>How come you got to come down
here to see me about it?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker><p>Well,
you will either have to make room in this office for the rest of the prisoners
or build me some more rooms to the jail.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(surprised)
</stage><p>Jail all filled up already?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker><p>There
ain't room enough down there for another man no matter how small he may be.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>I didn't know there was dat many criminals in
town.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker><p>Well,
this ain't exactly a matter of criminals. You knows I gits fifty cents a head
for every man I locks up.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>Well,
there's one man I will give you fifty dollars if you lock him up&#8212;that's
that Slippery Jim. He's the worst man in town.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Oh, he's a bad character, no doubt.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>Bad!</stage><p> He's <hi rend="underline">so</hi>
bad, I'm scared to pass a law against him.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>And I made up my mind yesterday to lock him up.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>You
made up your mind&#8212;?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Yes, yes.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>&#8212;Dat's 'bout as fer as you got,
too,&#8212;to make up your mind.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>And for three solid hours yesterday, I was
chasing him.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Didn't he catch you?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker>
<p> I was chasing him.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>I just wanted to know if you was the party of
the first part or not.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker><p>No,
I was the recessory after the crime. You see, in the first place, I chased him
everywhere.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(interested)
</stage><p>Chased him everywhere?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker><p>And
then I chased him everywhere else. For three solid hours yesterday, me and
Slippery Jim was just like this here <stage>(making
motions with hands)</stage> all over town.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Is dat a fact?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Yes.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>What do you know about dat?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>And finally he tripped up and fell right in
front of me.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(becoming
excited) </stage><p>Fell in front of
you???????</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Right in front of me.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>There
was your chance right then. When he fell, that was your chance.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker><p>And
I knowed it. And I said to myself, "I'm gwine to unveil myself of this
retunity."</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Yeh, yeh.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker><p>And
just as I reached over der to get him,&#8212;</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>Just
as you were gwine to get him,&#8212;</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker><p>Just
as I reached over there to get him, a black cat run right 'twixt us, and I had
to turn around and come back.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(hitting
desk with hand) </stage><p>I'm gwine to
pass a law to get rid of all the black cats right now.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>There you is!</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Black cats is bad luck anyhow.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker><p>Course
they is.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>Whenever
they commence conferring with the law, they got to go. Dat's all.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>There you is.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>A black cat run right 'twixt you and duty.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Ain't done nothing else.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(taking
pencil) </stage><p>Here's the first law
I'm gwine to pass since I've been the Mayor. "Black cats must go." "Black c c c
c . . ." Say, look here, Sam, how do you spell "cat" anyhow?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>What do you mean? One of dem jes' plain,
everyday, walkin' 'round cats?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>No,
jes' "cat." Any kind of a cat. I don't care what kind of a cat it is. Spell the
easiest one. You can't pass a law unless you kin spell "cat." You know dat,
don't you?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK.</speaker><stage>(puzzled)
</stage><p>Lemme see now,&#8212;"cat."</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Looks like to me anybody ought-to-could spell "cat."</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Well, if dey kin spell anything at all, dey kin
spell "cat."</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Der ain't but six letters in it.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Is you sure of dat?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Well, I bet my money der ain't <hi rend="underline">over</hi> six. I know dat.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker><p>Well,
I kin bring dat down to five 'cos I knows the "l"
is silent, so dat leaves you only five letters for to deal wid.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Yes, but I got to know what dey is and how to
rotine dem.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker><p>Dat's
right, too. Well, I've been away from my 'rithmestic so long, I'm a little
rusty on it now.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>Ha! Ha! I got it. You can't stick the Mayor you
know.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Course you can't.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(proudly)
</stage><p>You know what I'm gwine to do?</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>What's dat?</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker>
<p>I'll draw one. <stage>(draws a cat on the paper)</stage> Yes, and dat don't look like a cat.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Well, dat's all right. You kin read your own
writin'.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS. </speaker><p>No,
I guess I better call them stenographers in here and let them write dat law
out. I'll let dem go to dinner, though, first.</p></sp>



<sp><speaker>SAM PECK. </speaker>
<p>Sure.</p></sp>


<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>Stenographers!</stage><p> This way.</p>

<sp><speaker>STEVE JENKINS.</speaker><stage>(standing

way is dat for you all to leave the presence of the Mayor? How often have I told
you, whenever you leave the Mayor's office, you wants to slam the Mayor. I'm

<stage>SONG:
"If You've Never Been Vamped By a Brownskin (You've Never Been Vamped at All)"</stage>

<sp><speaker>SAM PECK</speaker>
<lg>

<l>Deacon Birch of Mt. Zion Church</l>

<l>Was hailed up into court.</l>

<l>He was brought in by his wife, I think,</l>

<l>And charged with non-support.</l>

</lg>

<lg>

<l>A sealskin brown with jet-black hair</l>

<l>Caused Deac' to lose his head.</l>

<l>And when the judge called Deac' to speak,</l>

<l>Dese am the words he said:</l>

</lg>

<lg>

<l>If you've never been vamped by a brownskin,</l>

<l>You've never been vamped at all,</l>

<l>For the vampingest vamp is a brownskin.</l>

<l>Believe me now, that ain't no stall.</l>

<l>A high brown gal will make you break out of jail,</l>

<l>A choc'late brown will make a tadpole smack a whale,</l>

<l>But a pretty sealskin brown, I mean one long and tall,</l>

<l>Would make the silent Sphinx out in the desert bawl.</l>

<l>If you've never been vamped by a brownskin,</l>

<l>You've never been vamped at all.</l>

<l>Eyes that will just hypnotize.</l>

Something nice, you know:</l>

<l>"Honey, Honey[, Honey]"</l>

<l>My baby dear</l>

<l>In a country town in Maryland,</l>

<l>Lived a little girl, the village pride.</l>

<l>Ev'rybody called her Mary Ann,</l>

<l>She was the pet of all the countryside.</l>

<l>When Mary Ann left Maryland</l>

<l>Ain'tcha coming back,</l>

<l>Ain'tcha coming back,</l>

<l>I've got the low-down, the lowest of the low-down blues.</l>

<l>It's not because I'm broke with all my clothes in pawn,</l>

<l>But since that morn I woke and found my sweetie gone,</l>

<l>With that mournful news, I got the lowest of the low-down
blues.&#8212;</l>



<l>Believe me now, that fellow never told no lie</l>

<l>Who said you'll never miss the water 'till the well runs dry.</l>

<l>The one who took my sweetie'd better leave this shore,</l>

<l>Or there will surely be some crepe a-hangin' on his door.</l>



<l>I've got the low-down, the lowest of the low-down blues.</l>

<l>Seems just like my crown is sinkin' through my shoes.</l>
