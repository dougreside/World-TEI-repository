PRELUDE.

</head>
<stage>
<hi rend="underline">A STORM at SEA.</hi>-- A ship on the horizon founders and breaks up.--
As ship disappears beneath the waves a girl is
seen clinging to a floating chicken-coop.--
This coop also contains a mule and a chicken.
It drifts across stage and disappears, in wings.

<head>SCENE 1.--THE ROSE KINGDOM.--
</head>
<stage>Stage set to represent a huge hothouse,
with dome roof and sides representing panes of
glass. The background is gauze, with a supplementary
setting of "The Royal Gardens" behind it.--AT RISE, no
lights back of gauze, front lights making the background
appear opaque.--In foreground, groups of girls
are discovered dressed to represent Roses, surrounding
BETSY BAKER who is sitting down with the chicken on
her shoulder and Mule by her side.

OPENING CHORUS:
</head>
<sp><speaker>
ROSES:</speaker>
<lg>
<l>What an impolite intrusion!</l>
<l>You have filled us with confusion--</l>
<l>An action most ungracious in a mortal such as you!</l>
<l>We are occupied in growing</l>
<l>And you really must be going</l>
<l>For to interfere with roses is a careless thing to do.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>
BETSY:</speaker>
<lg>
<l>But I've just been badly wrecked</l>
<l>And I surely can expect</l>
<l>A little hospitality in such a bow'r of beauty,</l>
<l>But I'll tell you what's the matter:</l>
<l>There are thorns in all your chatter,</l>
<l>And some day you will be reproached for laxness in your duty.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>
ROSES:</speaker>
<lg>
<l>We are very cultivated;</l>
<l>Our variety is stated</l>
<l>By expert horticulturists to be exceeding rare,</l>
<l>But when angered ev'ry petal</l>
<l>Is at once upon its nettle,</l>
<l>And every bud and blossom is as dangerous as fair.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>
BETSY:</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Hey dey! That is to say,</l>
<l>You're pretty to look at but horrid to Strangers!</l>
<l>Heigh ho! Where shall we go?</l>
<l>Wherever we wander we run into dangers.</l>
</lg></sp>
<pb/>

<note>OZMA-----5.</note>

<sp><speaker>HANK:</speaker>
<p>Hee haw!</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Poor little Hank!</l>
<l>There's no one to love us or comfort us, dear.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>HANK:</speaker>
<p>Hee haw!</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Who but a crank</l>
<l>Would turn us away when we want to stay here?</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>ROSES:</speaker>
<lg>
<l>You are very pert and saucy!</l>
<l>And inclined to be quite bossy,</l>
<l>But we'll not submit to impudence from any mortal maid!</l>
<l>Spite of all your bluff and braying</l>
<l>You have no excuse for staying</l>
<l>This hot-house is too warm for you we're very much afraid.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<lg>
<l>Roses, you are on the scent!</l>
<l>Fragrant though you stalk,</l>
<l>Vagrant is the scent-I-meant</l>
<l>That prevades your talk!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Though so dainty now you look,</l>
<l>You're a lot of loons:</l>
<l>When you get the pruning-hook</l>
<l>You'll be full of prunes.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>
ROSES:
</speaker>
<lg>
<l>You are very inconsistent,</l>
<l>For although you are persistent</l>
<l>In claiming hospitality where none is offered you:</l>
<l>We must still insist on saying</l>
<l>That our laws we are obeying</l>
<l>By forcing you to leave us and to bid our land adieu.</l>
</lg>
</sp>
</div>
<div>

<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>I'm not welcome here, I guess!</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>MOSS ROSE:</speaker>
<p>Why did you come?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Couldn't help it, my dears. A little while ago I was all at
sea, but the ship broke up in business and I became a floater.
I stranged on your shore, outside, and here I am---me and dear
old Hank and Baden-Baden.
</p></sp>
<pb/>

<note>OZMA-----6.</note>

<sp><speaker>TEA ROSE:</speaker><p>
Who are Hank and Baden-Baden?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Hank's my mule---faithful and true; ain't you Hank?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>HANK:</speaker>
<p>Hee haw!</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>CHORUS:</speaker>
<p>How dreadful!</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Only at first. When you get used to it, it puts you to sleep.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>MOSS ROSE:</speaker>
<p>And who is Baden-Baden?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>My spring chicken. You can't see the springs: they're inside.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>
JACQUE ROSE:</speaker><p>
Are the springs the most important part of Baden-Baden?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Oh, no. The most important thing is the Casino.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>TEA ROSE:</speaker>
<p>Why don't you <hi rend="underline">call</hi> her Casino?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Don't want to make game of her. <del rend="strikethrough">She's an innocent pullet just
new. When she gets older she'll be a pusher!</del> But say, Roses,
are we invited to your party, or not? Usually ship-wrecked
people are joyfully received wherever they land. It's considered
lucky, you know.
</p>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MOSS ROSE</speaker>
<p>For whom?</p>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>For those ship-wrecked.</p>
</sp>
<pb/>

<note>OZMA-----7.</note>
<sp><speaker>MOSS ROSE:</speaker>
<p>Inn't lucky for us. This is our own especial hot-house and 
only Roses are allowed here.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Some of you are pretty loud, that's true. <stage>(Turns to mule)</stage></p>
<p>
Hank, are we roses?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANK:</speaker>
<p>Hee haw! <stage>(Chicken flaps wings)</stage></p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>He says we are. Hank's a full-blown Jacque Rose. Even his
tail's bushy.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JACQUE ROSE:</speaker>
<p>
He's a jack; we can see that. But you must go away to some
other place. We cannot entertain you.
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Very well, I'll cut you dead. Then you'll be cut roses-----
thirty cents a dozen in the Bargain Basement.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>TEA ROSE:</speaker>
<p>We are perfectly fresh.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>You look it.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>MOSS ROSE:</speaker>
<p>And of excellent variety.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Then you ought to go into vaudeville. "Those roses that bloom
in the spring, tra, la!" You could do all right, you know.
</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>JACQUE ROSE:</speaker>
<p>
Cease this chatter, and leave us to ourselves.
</p></sp>

<note>OZMA-----8</note>

<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<stage>(Starting to go)</stage><p>Don't you need a gardener?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>MOSS ROSE:</speaker>
<p>We have one, who is responsible for our culture and beauty.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Then he's a wonder. Where is he?</p>
</sp>
<sp>
<speaker>
GARDENER</speaker>
<stage>(ENTERING hastily from R.)</stage> <p>Here I am!</p>
</sp>

<stage>(Hank makes a dive at the GARDENER, who runs and makes hasty
EXIT. A crash of glass is heard and the SHAGGY MAN falls
through a sash at L. ROSES all draw back startled and EXIT.
SHAGGY MAN is eating an apple as he comes to sitting position
on stage. BETSY, with Baden-Baden on her shoulder, and HANK,
approach him and look at him curiously. He continues to eat
his apple and pays no attention to his surroundings. Around
his waist are fragments of the sash. BETSY tries to lift it off.</stage>


<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Good gracious! Where did <hi rend="underline">you</hi> come from?</p>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<stage>(Pointing toward broken sash)</stage><p> From outside. Don't untie my
sash. It makes me feel dressed up. Ah, this is a pane-ful
experience. I climbed an apple-tree over yonder and the branch
gave way. I took a drop too much, and here I am. For the
first time in my life I might be accused of being a second-
story man.
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>You're in good company, then. Lots of these Roses are porch-
climbers. Say, gimme an apple!
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Wait a minute and see if there's a core. Apples aren't good for
little girls. They've caused most of the trouble in this world
from Eve down, and the less you eat of them the better off you
will be, and so will I.

MUSICAL NUMBER 2. SONG: SHAGGY MAN.<lb/>
"AN APPLE'S THE CAUSE OF IT ALL."
</head>
<sp>
<lg>
<l>In historee</l>
<l>An apple tree</l>
<l>In the Garden of Eden stood</l>
<l>And Adam and Eve</l>
<l>Did both believe</l>
<l>Its fruit was not much good.</l>
<l>Then long came a serpent mighty slick</l>
<l>And told 'em an apple they should pick</l>
<l>And eat it quick, and they did the trick</l>
<l>And the apple made 'em sick.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And so you see</l>
<l>In historee</l>
<l>An apple's the cause of the fall,</l>
<l>To eat it was surely considered unlawful,</l>
<l>But Eve took a bite and then Adam a jawfull:</l>
<l>The pain that it gave 'em was just something <hi rend="underline">awful</hi>--</l>
<l>An apple's the cause of it all.</l>
</lg>
<stage>2.</stage>
<lg>
<l>Perhaps you knew</l>
<l>The peach that grew</l>
<l>In the orchard was an apple.</l>
<l>And John and Sue,</l>
<l>If the story's true</l>
<l>With the apple had to grapple.</l>
<l>It laid 'em out in a minute or two,</l>
<l>And that's just what it'll do to you;</l>
<l>So the apple you had best eschew,</l>
<l>Or only chew a few.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now you'll agree</l>
<l>I guess with me</l>
<l>The apple's a colicky ball;</l>
<l>Some folks eat it green when they think it is ripe</l>
<l>And it gets in its work with an octopus gripe;</l>
<l>I'd much prefer Jeffries would give me a swipe--</l>
<l>And the apple's the cause of it all.</l>
</lg>
<stage>3.</stage>
<lg>
<l>An apple makes</l>
<l>More tummy-aches</l>
<l>Than rarebits, lobsters, cheese;</l>
<l>The doctor comes,</l>
<l>Looks wise, haw-hums</l>
<l>And tries your pain to ease.</l>
<l>But the apple laughs at the measely pill,</l>
<l>And the secton digs in the grave-yard still;</l>
<l>For as long as an apple has its will</l>
<l>It surely fights to kill.</l>
</lg>
<note>OZMA-----10</note>
<lg>
<l>And so I eat</l>
<l>'Em sour or sweet;</l>
<l>And wish I could eat 'em all!</l>
<l>It's a matter of taste, and the more diabolic</l>
<l>Your agony is, why, the more it will frolic,</l>
<l>And if you expire in a fit of the colic</l>
<l>An apple's the cause of it all!</l>
</lg>
</sp>
</div>
<div>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Dear me, I shouldn't think you'd dare eat apples.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Somebody's got to eat 'em, or they'd get so plentiful the whole
world would be one big tummy-ache. I'm willing to sacrifice
myself by eating all I can get, in a vain effort to save humanity.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Are you a rose?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Well, I rose from where I fell; didn't i?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>But this is a hot-house devoted especially to roses. They've
turned me out, and I suppose they'll turn you out, too.
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Nothing ever turns out the way you expect. <stage>(Points to mule)</stage></p>
<p>
Who's your friend?
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>His name is Hank.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Ah, a rag and a bone and a hank of hair.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>How's that?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Hank is Henry; and Henry is Harry---so Hank's hairy, isn't he?</p>
</sp>
<pb/>

<note>OZMA-----11.</note>

<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Sure! I never thought of that.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<stage>(Pointing to chicken)</stage><p> This is hen-nery, I s'pose.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>No; that's Baden-Baden.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Why didn't you get a good'n-good'n?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>When?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>When you were under the hen-roost.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>She's my own little chicken, that I raised from an egg.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>How'd you raise the egg?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Never you mind. What's <hi rend="underline">your</hi> name?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>They call me Shaggy Man. Lost the family bible and can't
remember what I was christened. Very young at the time.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
GARDENER
</speaker>
<stage>(ENTERING hastily, with an air of importance)</stage><p> Say, folks,
you'll have to get out of here.</p></sp>
<stage>(HANK makes a dash at him and GARDENER files out R.</stage>

<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>How did you happen to stray into these gardens?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Looking for my brother.</p>
</sp>
<pb/>
<note>OZMA-----12.</note>

<sp><speaker>HANK:</speaker>
<p>Hee haw!</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>You're wrong. No family resemblance.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Where is your brother?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Still looking for him. Want to hear the story of my life?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Is it copyright?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>No, it's all wrong. Brother and I owned a mine in Colorado---
real mine--no stocks. Scooped out gold nuggets by the pail-full,
Oh, joy! One day I left brother digging in the mine. When I
came back he was gone---mine was gone--- everything gone. Oh,
mis'ry!</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>And there were no stockholders?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Nary one.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>How strange!</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Couldn't understand it at first. Then I found on the spot where
the mine had been, an asbestos letter. Here it is.</p></sp>
<stage>(Hands paper to BETSY)</stage>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<stage>(Reads)</stage><p> "This mine is mine, so I have taken it away to my underground
kingdom, and with it the audacious mortal who was robbing

me of my gold. Let this be a warning to mankind not to interfere
with the right of, SIGNED: The Metal Monarch." Goodness
me, who's the Metal Monarch?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>That's a hard question to answer. He's metal.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>
GARDENER:</speaker>
<stage>(ENTERING hastily)</stage><p> Say, isn't it about time to move on?</p>
</sp>
<stage>(HANK makes a bolt for GARDENER who EXITS R.</stage>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Time to move, all right.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>I've heard of the Copper King, and the Steel King; but I never
before heard of the Metal Monarch. Where does he live?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>He didn't give his address.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>And is your brother still in his power?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>He must be. Brother's broke out of jail seven times, but the
Metal Kingdom must be too strong for him. Never mind. I mean
to find my brother some day, and rescue him.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>How?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p> I can't imagine. But as long as I've got the Love Magnet I'm
not worrying.</p>
</sp>

<p>It's a new invention; Dan Cupid patentee. Whoever owns the Love
Magnet wins the love of everyone he meets. No courting, car-fares,
flowers or theatre tickets. No trouble to borrow money;
always welcome when you visit your friends. Fine, ain't it? I
own this Love Magnet; and here it is!

<stage>(Takes from his pocket a shining silver magnet. Immediately the
GARDENER tries to embrace him, while BETSY leans against the
SHAGGY MAN and puts her arms around his neck. The mule comes and
kneels down at this feet and rubs his head against SHAGGY MAN'S
legs, while chicken flies from BETSY's shoulder to that of
SHAGGY MAN.</stage>

<stage>
Dark change, and a Transformation
of the rear drops, caused by the lights being raised behind the
gauze and lowered in front, discovers these Gardens beautifully
illuminated. The ROYAL GARDENS consist of a row of trees with
a high hedge in the extreme background, bearing beautiful flowers
illuminated with electric lights. Upon the low branches 
of the trees, people are growing in every stage of development.
There are fluffy blossoms with baby faces in them, babies and
children of all sizes standing among the leaves and low foliage,
and, in the foreground, (C.) upon a low limb, is a Royal
Princess of rare beauty. She is motionless, but fully developed,
daintily dressed, and seemingly "all ready to pick".

<p>She's wand-ering.</p>

<p>Look here, Betsy! I believe old Hank saw something strange

BETSY</speaker>
<p>
He did?</p> <stage>(Approaches)</stage>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Yes; Hank was hankering for something down here, and that's 
what made him act so foolish and mulish.
</p>
</sp>
<stage>(Together they look down the well.</stage>

<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Ha! Let's see what it is?</p>

<p>What have you found, beautiful one?</p>

<p>There's so many dents in him we might call him an accident.</p>

<sp><speaker>OZMA:</speaker>
<p>Do you think he's alive?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Not yet. All he's good for is old metal--half a cent a pound

<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>

<p>Dear me!</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>How strange!</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>He's a wonder!</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Isn't he complicated, though? But here's more. Listen!</p>
<stage>(Reads)</stage>
<p>
"Directions for Use: Wind up the Clockwork Man under his left
arm and he will think as cleverly as any rich man's son in the
world. Wind him up under his right arm and he will speak as
correctly as an after-dinner orator. Wind him up in the center
of his breast and he will move in a natural and intelligent
manner and act as well as Edwin Forrest."
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Ah, now we know when he was made---sometime in the last Century.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Then he ought to work yet, if we wind him up.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>OZMA:</speaker>
<p>Yes, he's guaranteed for a thousand years; perhaps he was intended 
for a Chorus Girl. Where's the key?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>This must be it. </p><stage>(He picks up key from a heap of metal.</stage>
<p>
Now let's get him ready for the operation.
</p>
</sp>
<stage>(BETSY and SHAGGY raise TIKTOK to his feet and move his joints
so that he will stand upright. He sways and topples this way
and that until they get him balanced so he stands steadily.
HANK prances joyfully around. The others are all much interested 
in the proceedings.)</stage>
<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>What is that thing on his forehead?</p>
</sp>

<pb/>

<note>OZMA-----31.</note>

<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Looks like an electric button. And here are some words on
it: "Don't touch!"</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>I wonder why not?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Can't say. But if we're going to follow directions we'd better 
not touch that button. Eh?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>All right. What part of him shall I wind up first?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>OZMA:</speaker>
<p>His thoughts, of course.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Yes; set his think-works going. If they work all right he'll 
be a free thinker.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Which is his left arm?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>That's the right one.</p>
<stage>(Points</stage>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>But I want the left.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Of course: the left one's the right one, isn't it?</p>
</sp>
<stage>(BETSY winds TIKTOK under left arm.)</stage>
<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>I don't see any difference, now he's wound.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Course you don't. He's just thinking.</p>

<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>

<p>I can hear him go, "tick-tock!"</p>

<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>
<p>Wind up his phonograph, Betsy, and see if that ticks. If he 
isn't fake he's got to explain himself.</p>

<stage>(She winds TIKTOK on his breast.
He moves automaticaly around

stop, front. The Clockwork Chorus
ENTERS.</stage>

<stage>(NOTE: Each girl has a clock over her head, her face appearing
in the center of the dial. From this a golden pendulum is suspended
and sways back and forth against her dark skirts,
which she holds spread out as she dances. Also in her
hand she has a "cricket" to sound "tick-tock" as required.
At the repetition of the second refrain the
clocks all strike the hour, or could even play the
melody as they strike, each clock having a bell in one
corner, which can be rung by a cord running to the girl's hand. 
This will all be arranged by Mr. Klein in the music score.)</stage>

<stage>
<hi rend="underline">SCENE 1.</hi>-- THE METAL MONARCH'S UNDERGROUND CAVERN.--This scene
consists of an irregular rock setting, the rocks
reaching nearly to the flies at background and at the 
wings. Perched upon these rocks in various places 
is the Chorus of METAL IMPS engaged in hammering metal
upon anvils. These anvils are tuned so that the blows
of the hammers play an anvil accompaniment to the
OPENING CHORUS, and as each blow is struck the different
anvils light up electronically, showing flashes of
different colors. The face of the rock is everywhere
set with colored jewels. These jewels are made by
setting imitation cut-glass saucers, with the rounding
side out, in the scenery, coloring them with transparent
colors and placing an electric light behind
each one. In the C. of the Cavern is the Metal
Monarch's Rocky Throne, which also glistens with colored
jewels. The METAL MONARCH is discovered seated
upon this throne, puffing a long pipe and wearing his
Magic Belt. This Belt is very broad and contains a
row of electric buttons. When the METAL MONARCH wishes
to perform any trick of magic, he pushes the proper
button to accomplish his object, and at once a bell
rings inside him to show that the magic has been performed.
NOTE: THE CHORUS OF METAL IMPS is <hi rend="underline">female</hi>.)

<p>
Your Majesty, there's a great demand for
love philters. Oughtn't we to manufacture some of them?
</p>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>RUGGEDO:</speaker><p>
Love! Love! What have <hi rend="underline">we</hi> to do with love? Hate's the only
thing <hi rend="underline">we're</hi> able to turn out. Never mind the love philters---
make water-filters, if you like.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>FLASH:</speaker>
<p>But love is very popular, just now, up on earth.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>RUGGEDO:</speaker><p>
I hate love!--but I wish I didn't. I abhor love--but I'd give
a gold button if I understood the idiotic sentiment. That's
one reason I hate mortals. They can love, and I can't. So I
hate 'em---I hate everybody!
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>FLASH:</speaker>
<p>And everybody hates you.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>What's that? Of course they hate me. Why shouldn't they?</p>

<stage>(Scene lightens and variegated rainbow hues

Are we not welcome, Ruggedo?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>No; you're both too pretty. I hate pretty girls.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Why, you old bear! If I once got my fingers in your whiskers
I'd tear 'em out by the roots!
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>You haven't any pull in this Kingdom, so be silent!</p>

</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Why, he's always so angry.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>You're right, I am. I hate everybody and everybody hates me.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>Oh, go out in the garden and eat wolly ones.</p>

<p>Can't you---if you try?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>I don't know. I've never tried. I don't know <hi rend="underline">how</hi> to try! Ihate all mortals because they rob my kingdom of its gold and
precious metals. If they keep on digging they'll bankrupt me!

<p>I'm the daughter of the Rainbow. But this mortal <stage>(Pointing to

</sp>
<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>Then I'll submit to her presence here, for your sake, little
rainbow. Here, Flash! <stage>(To Chief Imp)</stage> Take this crazy mortal to
the Royal Storehouse, and show her all the curious things we
manufacture. Keep her busy for awhile--understand?</p>
</sp>

<stage>(FLASH bows.
</stage>
<sp><speaker>BETSY:</speaker>
<p>I understand, too. You want to get me away, so you can make
love to Polly.

<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>Isn't your temper a little too violent?</p>

<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p><hi rend="underline">Your</hi> dear?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>Hem! Of course. You see, my pretty rainbow, I can't hate everybody and keep my temper at the same time. Im-possible!
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>But why hate <hi rend="underline">every</hi>body? You said you thought you could love me.
Don't you think you could make an exception in my case?
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>Perhaps; if I knew how to love. Do you know, if I once gotstarted I believe I could love frantically--furiously--distractedly!
It's all in knowing how, I suppose. Can't you
give me a lesson, little rainbow? What are the "three R's"
of love?
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>Recognition, recreation and recovery.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>And what is the geography of love?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>It's bounded on the North by Flirtation; on the East by Fascination;
on the South by Revelation; and on the West by----
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>Well?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>Separation.</p>

<p>Don't know. How should <hi rend="underline">I</hi> know? But I've heard 'em mentioned.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>I imagine you know more than I can teach you, Ruggedo. Perhaps

<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p><stage>(Tenderly)</stage> Well, I once came from Missouri, my dear.</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>On the Rainbow love means happiness, a merry heart and
contentment. When I lived there I loved only my father, and
went to him in all my troubles.
</p>

<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>Is that one of the privileges of love?</p>

</sp>

<p>State your conditions, my dear.</p>

<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>First: you must release the Ugly Man, the Shaggy Man's brother.</p>

<sp><speaker>SHAGGY:</speaker>

you must march with all your armies to the Rose Kingdom and
force Ozma's rebellious subjects to accept her as their Queen---
---and Private Files as her Royal Consort.
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>ANN:</speaker>
<p>Why so?</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>POLY:</speaker>
<p>Because this is a case of true love, and everyone is bound to

with the refrain as follows: costumes so provided that the back
oof each represents a section of a red rose, extending from the
head-dress, with stiff leaves projecting below the hips. The
girls are arranged in a circle upon a low platform, their bodies
inclined horizontally so that their heads meet in the center,
their hands resting upon thier knees. In this position a perfect
rose is displayed. The platform is drawn upon the stage by wires,
when the girls stand upright, facing the audience, and dance to
the refrain. Then they again form the rose upon the platform
and are pulled off stage.)</stage>

their mouths and clapping thier hands. All stiff
and worked by wires. The suggestion is up to Mr.
Voegtlin...During this scene SHAGGY pounds TIKTOK
and hurts his own fists more than he does the Clockwork Man.
TIKTOK lands one blow, after many efforts, which doubles up the
SHAGGY MAN, who returns to the fight dancing around at a safe
distance. He pauses for breath.

<note>OZMA-----121.</note>

<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>True. I now possess the magic metal.</p>

<sp><speaker>RUGG:</speaker>
<p>Why, it would be a fitting punishment for all the trouble youcaused me in putting Tiktok together. Will you give it back,
Ann, whenever I demand it?
</p>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>ANN:</speaker>
<p>Of course I will! Tiktok's lost to me, and I've got to havesome man, or I'll die an old maid!

ask you to return.
