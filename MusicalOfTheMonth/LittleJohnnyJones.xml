<stage>(Opening number done by starter and all the chorus.)</stage>
<stage>(At opening of number reformers enter from 1st entrance left, and enter
hotel, and appear on balcony.)</stage>
<stage>(During number the newsboy comes from 1.E.L. deals out papers to members
of chorus, while he and starter are singing, starter following
him around.)</stage>
<stage>(At finish of number, cabbies down stage - exit 1.E.L. and chorus stays
up stage - pantomine talk.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<stage>(Calling off L.1.E.)</stage> <p>Here, here, keep to the left - keep to
the left. </p><stage>(Sarcastic)</stage><p> Drives his cab to the right like a
blooming Yankee. </p><stage>(Enter Henry from hotel and down to starter)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Good morning, starter. </p><stage>(Starter turns to R.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>A ripping nice morning, yes sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Fine day for the derby.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>Yes indeed, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Henry turns to L. and looks up at decorations.)</stage><p> Tell me, what
are these decorations for.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>Decorations, haven't you heard? Sing Song, the great Chinese
newspaper man here to see the Derby. They do say the Emperor
sent him. Four of the Emperor's wards are with him, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Emperor's wards!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>Sure. Chinese women my word, they are a sight.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Are there many Americans here?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>All sorts and sizes, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Notice any uncommon, extraordinary, I might say suspicious ones
among them?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>Say, where are you from? Scotland Yards?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry</speaker>
<stage>(Laughing)</stage><p> Why?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>You talk like a blooming inspector. Something up, is there?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Hesitatingly)</stage><p>
Why no, -- but --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>Something you want to know, sir? </p><stage>(Holding out hand)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>There you are again - well here. </p><stage>(Slips him tip)</stage> <p>Is there a
Mrs. Kenworth here?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Kenworth, oh, yes, sir. She's been here for several
days, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Who's with her? </p><stage>(THEY go to R. of stage)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>A lot of young females, sir. Some sort of a reforming society,
I understand. They look like Salvation Army folks to me, sir.
</p>
</sp>
<stage>(At this girls enter from hotel. Come down stage, all turn and look up
at balcony, and discover reformers. Pointing up and laughing, both
Henry and Starter turn, and both look up at balcony and cross to extreme
left.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
 <stage>(All excited)</stage> <p>There they are, sir. Them is them, sir.</p>
<stage>(At this girl comes down stage C. surrounded by all the girls
and Starter stays extreme L. looking off. Henry goes up stage,
talks to boys.)</stage></sp>

<pb/>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>Do you know who they are?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All the Girls.</speaker>
<p>
No.</p>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>
They're the San Francisco Female Reformers.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All.</speaker>
<stage>(Laugh)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>They tried to close up the Chinese Lottery game. </p><stage>(Girls
all laugh-turn and go up stage. 1st girl goes up to extreme
R. and Henry comes down to Starter.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Much obliged to you Starter for the information.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<stage>(Holding out hand)</stage><p> Anything else I can do, sir?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Yes, stop holding out your hand all the time. </p><stage>(Laughs, runs
up to hotel and exits.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>Thank you sir. </p><stage>(Turns to L. and calls off)</stage><p> Here, here-
drive to the left - drive to the left. </p><stage>(Exits L.1.E.)</stage><stage> (In
the meantime, boy comes from door R. down to first girl
with papers - she takes one, reads and goes to C.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<stage>(Reading paper)</stage><p> Look here, girls, it says Yankee Doodle is
the favorite in the Derby. </p><stage>(All get around her.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>2nd Girl.</speaker>
<p>Who rides Him?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>It doesn't say. </p><stage>(Enter McGee from hotel and right down to
girls.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(As he comes on)</stage><p> That's all right now, etc.-----</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Girls.</speaker>
<stage>(All turn)</stage><p> It's Mr. McGee. </p><stage>(All run up to him and crowd
around him) </stage><stage>(Business here of him trying to back away, and
finally succeeds.)</stage><stage> (All come down stage.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(1st girl at his R.)</stage><p> By gorra's I wish you girls wouldn't
be so glad to see me, but say, I got great news for you,
but remember it's a secret.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All.</speaker>
<stage>(All interested)</stage><p> A secret? </p><stage>(Get close)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs)</stage><p> I can see this bunch keeping a secret. Listen to
this. "Go as far as you like on the English Derby". J. J.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>Who's J. J.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Johnny Jones, the American jockey.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>What's he ride?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Yankee Doodle, and any time Jones says bet, the race is in.
He left Paris last night - he'll be here before noon.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>Will you introduce us to Mr. Jones?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Don't be afraid, he'll introduce himself. Now remember I've
chartered a tally-ho for the Derby and we'll all go together.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All.</speaker>
<stage>(Delighted and go up stage.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(To first girl with arm around her)</stage><p> But don't mention the
tip. Mum's the word.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>Mum's the word.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee. </speaker>
<p>And if they run out of Mums, we'll drink any old thing
they've got.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<stage>(With arm around him)</stage><p> Do you know Mr. McGee I think you're
the dearest, darlingest and sweetest man that ever - - -
</p><stage>(Bus. of taking roll of greenbacks from his pockets.)</stage>
<pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside - seeing her take money.)</stage><p> Rough work - rough work.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<stage>(Fooling with money)</stage><p> What's this, American Money?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Yes, American money.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>It's no good over here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Taking it and putting it in pocket on other side.)</stage><p> No, then
I'll put it over here.
</p><stage>(At this, 1st girl releases him and runs off - sore. Exits
1st entrance R.)</stage> <p>But all joking aside</p>
<stage>(Turns and girls all come down and surround him.)</stage><p> I'd like
to meet you girls in New York.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All girls.</speaker>
<stage>(Chorus-)</stage> <p>Oh, New York.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>I may not be the whole thing in England, but in New York,
why say-- they're all my friends.
</p><stage>(MUSIC CUE - SONG - "THEY'RE ALL MY FRIENDS" - done by McGee and
Chrous. - at finish of number the girls all exit either side
and music continues and McGee and boys continues singing and
dancing. At finish boys exit. 1st E. L. and Reformers
exit balcony. McGee sits at right of table at extreme left.
Boy enters from door R. whistling. McGee turns and calls
him.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Boy comes over.)</stage><p> Say, Boy, is there any mail?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Boy.</speaker>
<p>What's the name, sir?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Timothy D. McGee.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>I'll see, sir. </p><stage>(Exits door L.)</stage><stage> (Enter Fly from hotel - comes
down to table where McGee is.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Timothy D. McGee -- in London, quite a bit of news for the
society columns I must say.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>I'm all out of wind, a man of any age shouldn't be dancing.
</p><stage>(Turns L. recognizes her.)</stage>
<p>Florabelle Fly!</p> <stage>(Gets up and shakes hands)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>As ever yours, Florabelle. </p><stage>(Sits down)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>What brought you here?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>The American line, of course.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Here to do the Derby, eh?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Exactly, and incidentally making notes of the different
celebrities, I come in contact with.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Still in the newspaper business, eh?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Still scribbling scribbles for the San Francisco Searcher.
Tell me, what are you doing here, Mack?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Come to see the Derby.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.
Is that all?
</speaker>
<p>McGee.
And why?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Oh, nothing, I see Anthony Anstey is here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Surprised.)</stage><p> Anthony Anstey.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.
Yes.

McGee.</speaker>
<p>In London?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker><p>
Yes.
</p>
<pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>What's he here for?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Why do you ask?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee</speaker>
<p>Oh, nothing, but - - -</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>But you have an idea he's here after Johnny Jones, isn't that
is, Mack?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>No, not exactly - - -</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>And you are here for the same purpose.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>And who told you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Common Sense. If I meet a lady in Paris, I know she's there
for hats and gowns. If I meet a horse owner in London, I know
he's here for Johnny Jones. Have you seen him yet?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Well, to tell you the truth, I have not.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Don't be afraid Mack. I'll not print your secret. Where is
Jones?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>He's on his way from Paris. </p><stage>(At this Fly gets up - crosses in
front of table and stools to C.)</stage> <p>Gets here about noon, I
guess. But tell me, Fly, are you sure Anstey's after him.
</p><stage>(Fly turns L. to McGee.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Do you know a horse owner who isn't?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>I guess you're right.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>You see Anstey's in a trifling way connected with the story I'm
after, for the Searcher, and oh, such a story, Mack. </p><stage>(At this
she strolls to McGee's side)</stage> <p>Inside of a few days I expect to
have a page or two of sensational reading that will throw our
'Frisco competitors into seven kinds of journalistic fits. </p><stage>(Then
she turns and strolls to extreme right.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.
Murder?

Fly.</speaker>
<p>No.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.
Robbery?
</speaker>
<p>Fly.
No.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee
Love affair.
</speaker>
<p>Fly.
There you have it. </p><stage>(McGee gets up and goes over to Fly. Laughs.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Story about a girl going to marry an English Lord.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>No, a story about a girl who doesn't want to marry an English
Lord.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>That ought to make a good story. </p><stage>(Enter servant - 2nd entrance
L. with note on tray and hands same to McGee.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Leave that to me. </p><stage>(Business)</stage> <stage>(Servant calling McGee by name)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Boy.
Mr. McGee?
</speaker>
<p>McGee.
</p><stage>(Looking at note)</stage> <p>What's this? </p><stage>(Business. Reads)</stage> <p>Sing
Song wants to see me. </p><stage>(Bus. Boy. bows affirmatively, and goes
to 2nd E.L. and stays there.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.
Sing Song?
</speaker>
<p>McGee.
Yes, the Chinese newspaper man. Here to do the Derby. Haven't
you met him?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker><p>
I'd like to.
</p>
<pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Come on, I'll introduce you. </p><stage>(Turns to go at same time to
servant.)</stage> <p>Tell him I'll be right there. </p><stage>(Exits servant.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs)</stage><p>
Chinese newspaper man - whoever heard of such a thing?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Yes, the Editor of the Pekin Gazette, and a real live sport.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.
(Laughs)</speaker>
<p>Chinaman, - Sport?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Sent here by the Emporer.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>The Emperor? </p><stage>(MUSIC CUE. Soft Waltz.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>So they say, but come on, I want you to meet him. </p><stage>(Exits door L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<stage>(Follows)</stage><p> This will make a story in itself. Chinese newspaper
man - funniest thing I ever heard. </p><stage>(Exits laughing)</stage> <stage>(Enter
Henry from Hotel. Looks about. Enter boy from door L. Shouting
"Johnny Jones". Crosses and exits in door R.)</stage> <stage>(Music Forte now.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(When boy exits, Henry comes down stage and calls.)</stage><p> All right
Goldie, come right along, the coast is clear. </p><stage>(Music double
Forte, and enter Goldie Gates from hotel, over to table R.)
(Henry follows)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Are you quite sure?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Not a soul in sight. </p><stage>(Fly enters from door L. goes to C. and
discovers them.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>What a relief. I've never been so nervous in all my life.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Pluck up courage- everything is going along nicely. I've a
thousand things to tell you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Do you suppose any one suspects?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>No, but be careful. Don't get into conversation with any one.
I've given them to understand here that you're a French girl,
and no one knows a thing about you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Except Florabelle Fly. What a story - what a scoop for the
Searcher. </p><stage>(Turns and exits in door L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Tell me, what have you heard?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>A thousand things, Goldie. To begin with, your aunt has
engaged herself to be married.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.
To whom?
</speaker>
<p>Henry
Anthony Anstey, an American gambler. </p><stage>(At this Goldie sits at
R. of table)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>A gambler? Anthony Anstey? He comes from 'Frisco and is well
known.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Notoriously so. That man would rob a newsboy of a Canadian
dime.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Aunt Annette engaged to be married. </p><stage>(Laughs)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Now don't get meritorious.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>But what of this husband she's picked out for me - this nobleman?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Lord Walter Wetherington-Earl of Bloomsbury.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>The Earl of Bloomsbury!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Yes, a young man who desires to tie up with an American
heiress. Anstey is to introduce him to your Aunt.

</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Oh, then she hasn't met him yet?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>No, I understand he is to be here today.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Good, then I'll get a look at my future husband.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Goes in back of table)</stage><p> Look here, Goldie, there is some sort of
a game on foot between this man Anstey and this Chinese newspaper
man, Sing Song.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>What makes you think so?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Closeted meetings. Whispered conversations - all sorts of
mysterious notions. </p><stage>(Henry goes up to the L. side of table.
Faces Goldie.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>What sort of a looking man is this Anstey?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Well, he's a man of about fifty, rather short, keen-eyed and-</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(From inside)</stage><p> Going to the Derby? Well, I should say I am
going to the Derby.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Here he is now. </p><stage>(Henry goes L. Enter Anstey from hotel-
comes down stage C.)</stage> <stage>(Goldie takes paper and reads)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Glorious land of the - - - - - </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Goes over to Anstey)</stage><p> Good morning, Mr. Anstey, good morning,
sir!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns)</stage><p> Ah, good morning. Why as I live, the young man
I met at the American bar last evening. </p><stage>(Holds out hand)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Shakes his hand)</stage><p> The same sir. Identically the same.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Fine day for the Derby.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Glorious. </p><stage>(Goes to L. table)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns discovers Goldie.)</stage><p> Who's your friend?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Oh, beg pardon, allow me. </p><stage>(Crosses)</stage> <p>Mlle., I present
Monsieur Anstey, Rosario Fanchonette - </p><stage>(Goldie gets up and
Henry crosses to L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Bowing)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(Bus. dialect)</stage><p> Delighted Monsieur. Oh, you have such
beautiful hair.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Let's all have a drink. </p><stage>(Calls)</stage> <p>Waiter. </p><stage>(Waiter who has
been up stage comes down.)</stage> <p>A quart of wine - you know the
vintage I mean.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>Aye, Governor. </p><stage>(Waiter bows affirmatively - exits into
hotel.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to Goldie)</stage><p> You are going to the Derby, I suppose.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Oui, oui, that is why I come from Paris. </p><stage>(Goldie goes in
back of right chair.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Goes to table R.)</stage><p> Oh, you come from Paree.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Comes over to him.)</stage><p>
Yes, she's a French girl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>A French girl, well, well! A French girl from Paree. That's

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>That is rather strange. </p><stage>(Turns and goes L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>You are an American gentleman? Yes? </p><stage>(Anthony sits down.)</stage>

<pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Henry comes over to Anstey.)</stage><p> American, all wool and a yard
wide. </p><stage>(Goldie and Henry laugh.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>What makes the Americans so proud of their country?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Other countries.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs)</stage><p> Henry.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Coughs)</stage><p> Very good, very good! </p><stage>(Turns and goes L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>You like the Americans, eh?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Not so much. The English are much better.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Bus. coming close to Anstey.)</stage><p> Yes, you see, Mlle. prefers
titled gentlemen. She has a score of acquaintances amongst
the nobilities.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(To Henry)</stage><p> Run away, young man, run away. </p><stage>(At this Henry
turns and goes L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Nobility! Do you know the Earl of Bloomsbury?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Ah! He is my dear friend. </p><stage>(Anstey interested. Henry up
stage, watches what is going on.)</stage> <p>He will be here today.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>No, the Earl will not be here for a week.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Will not be here for a week.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>No, not for a week.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Tell me, who is this heiress?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Only a school girl. </p><stage>(At this Goldie crosses in back of
table to C. and motions Henry to go.)</stage> <stage>(Henry goes up
steps of hotel and stays there.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Only a school girl?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Yes, a beautiful young school girl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>She is very beautiful?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(At this Anstey gets up and goes over to Goldie.)</stage><p> Well, I've
never seen her myself, but - - - </p><stage>(Bus. of leaning over
to her.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Ah, you're engaged to be married.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Now, who told you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I heard, Madam Kenworth has lots of money.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Yes, she has lots of money.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie</speaker>
<stage>(Jabs him in the ribs.)</stage><p> Ah, you are a wise old guy, all
right, all right.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs)</stage><p> A wise old guy?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>You are a flirt Monsieur. </p><stage>(At this Henry exits in hotel)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>A flirt, in London, why not? Paris is a gay town. </p><stage>(Laughs)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>You've never been in Paree?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.
Never.

say as how you were in a hurry, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Americans are always in a hurry.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>So it seems, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>I don't want the wine now.</p></sp>

<p>Very good, sir. </p><stage>(Bus. Turns. exits in door L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.
Isn't it?

No sir. England's on the map, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.
Is it?
</speaker>
<p>Starter.
Yes, sir. Anything else, sir?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.
No sir.

Thank you, sir. </p><stage>(And starts to exit.)</stage></sp>

a surprise.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee. </speaker>
<p>What are you doing over here?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Well, I was always crazy to come to London. </p><stage>(McGee and
Anstey stroll to table L. McGee sits at L. Anstey at R.

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>I think anybody's crazy to come to London.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Here to see the Derby?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Yes, that is I - - - - -
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>I see Johnny Jones rides in the Derby. </p><stage>(She gives them both a
look)</stage> <stage>(McGee and Anstey both turn and look at each other, and
then turn away)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p> Just as I suspected.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p> He's after the kid sure enough. </p><stage>(Fly goes to C.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p> I'll keep my weather eye on you, Mr. Anstey. </p><stage>(Anstey
turns.)</stage> <p>Bye, bye gentlemen. </p><stage>(Both get up and bow.)</stage> <p>I must dig
up some more celebrities for my article on Americans abroad.
News is not hard to find around the Cecil hotel. </p><stage>(Exits into
hotel.)</stage> <stage>(Anstey and McGee sit down again)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>How's 'Frisco?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.
Slam Bang.
</speaker>
<p>McGee.
How is the stable?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Not so loud, Mack.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>What's the matter, ruled off?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Hardly. But it isn't necessary that every one should know
that I'm a race track man. Why not a retired merchant or
something of that sort?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>And what's the idea?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Women at the bottom of it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee</speaker>
<stage>(Surprised)</stage><p> Women, and who is your friend?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>More than my friend, my fiancee.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.
Engaged?
</speaker>
<p>Anstey.
Surest thing you know. Came all the way from 'Frisco together -
got so we could coo in a business-like manner.
By the time we hit London, we were engaged to be married.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Wonderfully romantic. I suppose you told her everything you
know. </p><stage>(Bus. Anstey gets up strolls to C. and turns.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>She's heard my life story from the cradle to the grave.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Did you tell her your right name?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>She knows my name, but not my game.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>She doesn't suspect that you're mixed up with the ponies.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Ponies - why certainly not. You must know, my dear boy, she
is the President of an organization known as the San Francisco
Female Reformers, a band of young Western damsels that would
make any Parkhurst Society blush with shame. Why their attack
upon 'Frisco's Chinatown cleaned out the pigtail quarters,
</p><stage>(Bus. Anstey strolls to C. and then strolls back behind table 
to such an extent that the Highbinders have already threatened
the life of the future Mrs. Anstey.</stage> <stage>(At this boy enters from
hotel shouting.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Boy.</speaker>
<p>Telegram for Johnny Jones. </p><stage>(Continues shouting and exits door
R. At same time American boy and girl enter from E.R. and
exit into hotel. Anstey by this time is behind table and McGee
gets up. Both look toward boy; after boy exits McGee sits down

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>The Highbinders threatened her life?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Still watching boy)</stage><p> Eh! </p><stage>(Bus. then goes and sits down.)</stage>
<p>Papers still full of it all over the Pacific Coast.</p>
<pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>What brought her to London?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Here to find a suitable husband for her niece. An Earl, a
Duke, or something of that sort.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.
Her Niece?
</speaker>
<p>Anstey.
Yes, daughter of the late Gerald Gates.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Gerald Gates, the millionaire?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>My fiancee is his widowed sister, Mrs. Kensworth.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Andrew Kenworth - one of the richest women in the West?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Misjudge me not, man, I am not marrying her because she has
twenty millions.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>I understand.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey</speaker>
<p>I'd marry her if she had forty millions.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Spoken like a true American, and she's here to buy a title?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>That is if all the titles in England are not copyrighted.
</p><stage>(Music, soft waltz at this point and Reformers enter from
hotel)</stage> <stage>(A lot of talk and stay up stage.)</stage> <stage>(Anstey and
McGee get up, turn and see them.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(As reformers appear)</stage><p> Look, them are those, I mean those
are them, these are they.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Who are they?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey</speaker>
<p>Members of my fiancee's society.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Did she bring them with her?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>They are with her all the time.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(Spoken from within)</stage><p> Where are you, my chidren?
</p><stage>(Reformers line up R.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Here she is now. </p><stage>MUSIC FORTE.</stage><stage> (Enter Mrs. Kenworth from
hotel and down stage C.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Anthony.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>My dear Annette. </p><stage>(Goes to her - kisses her hand)</stage> <p>I present
an old time friend, Mr. McGee. </p><stage>(McGee crosses to Mrs. Kenworth)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Timothy D. McGee. At your service.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>From the other side?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>East side, tenth ward.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(Points to girls.)</stage><p> My children.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Bus. Surprised)</stage><p> Your children?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Not my daughters, my children. We are organized for a
purpose that is sweet and dear to us. We love each
other, do we not, my dearies?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Six.
Yes, Mamma.
</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Kenworth.
I suppose Anthony has told you of our engagment?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>He has, and allow me to congratulate you both, and permit me
to say that ever before has it been my good fortune to meet so
sweet and amiable a woman. </p><stage>(Bus. McGee gets very close to Mrs. Kenworth
at this.)</stage> <p>Such beauty, such elegance and such - - - -

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Calling him)</stage><p> Oh, Mack, just a minute.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(To Mrs. Kensworth.)</stage><p> Excuse me. </p><stage>(Turns to him and talks in
pantomine)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to Reformers)</stage><p> Now, children, remember London
is a very large city, and you must be very careful where and how you
get about. You should have an escort. </p><stage>(Looks over at Anstey, then
turns to Reformers again.)</stage> <p>I have it. </p><stage>(Calls.)</stage> <p>Anthony.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Yes, my dear. </p><stage>(Comes to her)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>I want you to show the girls about town. Point out
the different historial buildings and so on. </p><stage>(McGee laughs to himself.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>All right, my dear. </p><stage>(They cross. Mrs. Kenworth goes down to
McGee, who is looking the other way.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>And now Mr. McGee if it is not too much </p><stage>(McGee turns
and looks surprised.)</stage> <p>I will ask you to escort me as far as Picadilly.
I have quite some shopping to do.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>The pleasure is mine Mrs. Kenworth. </p><stage>(She takes his proffered
arm.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to Anstey.)</stage><p> You'll take good care of the little
dearies, won't you, Anthony?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>The Best of care, my dear.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs -- turns to Anstey.)</stage><p> Yes, be careful crossing the
streets.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(They start to exit)</stage><p> Now, you don't mind, do you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Not at all, not at all.</p></sp>

<p>It's very very kind of you.</p></sp>

go up stage. Anstey looks after McGee and Mrs. Kenworth, and then
down stage C.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Laugh on my proud beauty. He who laughs screams with
delight. You'll close up 'Frisco's China Lottery, will you? Cheat me
out of one hundred thousand dollars a year, will you? Wait till you
are Mrs. Anstey. </p><stage>(Anstey goes to table L.)</stage> <p>I'll soon teach you and
your crusading band of fool women to stay at home and mind your own
damn business. McGee wants Jones. He shan't have him. </p><stage>(Anstey sits
down)</stage> <p>I'll pay that Jockey more money than any man on the American
turf. </p><stage>(Reformers come down stage, extreme right at this and line up

<sp><speaker>Six.</speaker>
<p>We are waiting, kind sir.</p></sp>

<p>
Yes, six of them. Drive in a row like a circus parade.
Take good care of the little dearies, and see that they are back
here in an hour, and if anybody asks for me, tell them I am telling
funny stories to Sing Song, the Chinese newspaper man. </p><stage>(Exits in

<sp><speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>Did you call me, sir?</p></sp>

<p>No, but I will if you give me any lip. I'll call you or
anybody else. What time is it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>31st of May, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>I know the date, what time is it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>Correct, sir. Do you feel like a cup of tea, sir?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>No, I don't feel like a cup of tea. Do I look like a cup of
tea?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>I have a cup of tea here, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Well, go ahead and drink it, don't let me stop you.</p></sp>

You.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Waiter.</speaker>
<p>No sir, thirty-six. Is there anything else I can do, sir?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>If there was you wouldn't be a waiter. </p><stage>(Waiter turns and
exits into door L.)</stage> <p>Now he's what I call a nice little

<stage>(Enters at this from hotel down to Wilson)</stage><p> Morning, sir.
Like to take a drive this morning?</p></sp>

<p>The Starter?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>
Yes, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Well, don't you start anything you can't finish.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>Very good, sir.
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson</speaker>
<stage>(Looking at uniform)</stage><p> What are you, a soldier?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughing)</stage><p> No, sir. I'm not a soldier.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Well you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Why don't you be
a soldier? Go to war and fight for your country.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker> Starter.</speaker>
<p>But there's no war now, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Then start one. What's the good of brass buttons if there
ain't going to be a war?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>I hope we'll never have another war, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Hope we'll never have another war. How do you suppose the
soldiers are going to make a living if there ain't goin' to
be any war? </p><stage>(Starter laughs.)</stage><p>Come on, let's get a drink.</p>
<stage>(Takes Starter by the arm)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>I don't drink, sir. </p><stage>(At same time walks away.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Don't drink? How do you expect the saloons to keep open if
you don't drink? Gee, whiz, you've got a mean disposition.
You don't want any war, and you don't drink. If you keep on
you'll put all the soldiers and saloons and keepers out of 
business.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Twenty-three.</p></sp>

<p>
What, sir?
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>
Twenty-three.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>I don't understand, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Certainly you don't. I'll bet you a ten pound note you don't
know how much twenty-three is.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>I never gamble, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Never gamble. Now how do you expect to circulate currency?
Gee, whiz, you just signed a peace treaty, and throw all the
war correspondents out of work, Carrie Nations all the saloons
and now you're going to close up all the gambling houses.</p>
<stage>(Wilson crosses and stops)</stage> <p>You've got the meanest disposition
of any man I've met since I've been here, and I certainly had a
good time here in Pittsburgh.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>
Pittsburgh?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns)</stage> <p>I mean, London. Ain't it funny I always get these two
towns mixed? London and Pittsburgh. But say, no joking, London is
a great town for fun.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Never mind what these other Americans say, I've been a sport
all my life.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>You look it, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>And you take it from me, for a good time London makes
Worcaster and Springfield look like thirty cents. </p><stage>(Turns to go)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>Shall I call you a hansom sir?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Call me anything you like. </p><stage>(Singing)</stage> <p>Sticks and stones will
hurt my bones, but names will never break me. </p><stage>(Exits with
Starter - door R.)</stage> <stage>(Enter Florabelle with girls from hotel-
down stage C.)</stage>
<pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>You know I'm awfully glad to meet you girls, it's such a
treat for Americans to meet Americans abroad. All going to the
Derby, I suppose.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<stage>(At left of Fly.)</stage><p> Yes, Mr. McGee is going to take us.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Good, I'll be with you. We'll all put a bet on Yankee Doodle.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>Johnny Jones rides Yankee Doodle.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Yes, do you know him? </p><stage>(Girls shake heads)</stage> <p>It's a shame to
bet on him. It's like taking candy away from a baby.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>He must be a bird. </p><stage>(Crosses to extreme right.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Why girls he'll just coax that horse's nose by the wire like
the Yankee bird coaxed the English sparrow to America.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>We can talk better in the open Sing.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing Song.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside- Anstey at right of Sing)</stage><p> Tell me, Anstey, does
this American jockey Jones ride in to-day's Derby?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Jones is on the favorite, Yankee Doodle.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing Song.</speaker>
<p>And you think Mr. McGee is here to get him.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>He's not the only one. Ever since Jones made the fact
Public that he would return to America, hundreds of horse
owners have made him fabulous offers. I've already sent him
a check for ten thousand dollars for first call on his
services.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Ahha, the early bird, Eh?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, the wise owl. </p><stage>(Goes to table R.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>But this band of Reformers, where are they? </p><stage>(Takes stage.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey</speaker>
<p>You'll see them soon enough, never fear. </p><stage>(Both to table
and sit down. Anstey right chair, Sing left chair.)
(Wilson enters from door R. crosses to table L. and sits
down.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Tell me, why did you make the meeting place London?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Because the Chinese Lottery game is not safe in America
with Mrs. Kenworth there. I drove her from that country
with threats supposedly made by the Highbinders, followed
her here, forced my acquaintance upon her, now we are
engaged to be married.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>She has money?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey</speaker>
<p>All kinds, I'l get the money, never fear.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Anstey, you're a shrewd man.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>It's for your protection as well as my own. Haven't we
been partners for five years?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>True, the Chinese Lottery in America has made a fortune for
you and for me. But should the Emperor discover that I am
connected with the game - </p><stage>(Bus.)</stage> <p>off would go my head.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>How did you manage to get here? </p><stage>(Bus.)</stage> <stage>(Wilson gets up
and strolls up to hotel and enters.)</stage>
<pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Easily enough. Since your last visit to China, I've been
made editor of the Pekin Gazette. Upon receiving word from you
to come to London, I suggested to His Majesty the idea of coming
here and writing a story on the English Derby, so here I
am. Now what are your plans? </p><stage>(Anstey gets up and goes to C.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>You must come with me to San Francisco.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>And why? </p><stage>(Sing follows him.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Because the game is at a standstill. The Chinamen are afraid
to operate. All I've said and done is of no avail. A word
from you and the game goes on.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>But this woman and her band of - - - -</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Leave that to me - once my wife. I'll guarantee her band of
Reformers will be no more. </p><stage>MUSIC CUE- CHINESE MUSIC.</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Those are the Emperor's four favorite wards. Wanted to see
England and America, so he sent them in my charge. </p><stage>(Come down

<p>Mrs. Kenworth!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>
Yes, and Mr. McGee, the man that's after Jones.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>What about this nobleman? </p><stage>(At this Anstey crosses and goes
to extreme R. Sing follows.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>I get 50% of his income.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Antsey you are a shrewd man.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Antsey.</speaker>
<p>I'm a business man. </p><stage>(Both talking in pantomine. Enter
McGee and Mrs. Kenworth L.1.E. laughing)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Now don't over laugh yourself.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>I don't know when I've enjoyed a stroll so much.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Both stop at extreme left-laughing.)</stage><p> Here too, Mrs.
Kenworth, and all me to say that never before - - - -</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth</speaker>
<stage>(Screams when she sees Chinamen.)</stage><p> Look, look, save
me, save me, Anthony. </p><stage>(Gets behind McGee.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Antsey.</speaker>
<p>Why, what's the matter, my dear. </p><stage>(Crosses over to her.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(Crosses McGee to Anstey.)</stage><p> Anthony the Highbinders
are after me. </p><stage>(Laughter from all.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Nonsense, my dear. I have the honor to present Sing Song,
a Chinese newspaper man. This lady, Sing, is Mrs. Kenworth
of whom I wrote you in my last letter.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<stage>(Crosses to Mrs. Kenworth. Anstey goes to C.)</stage><p> Ah, Charmed
Mrs. Kenworth. Mr. Anstey has told me of the good work you
are doing and believe me I am as much opposed to Chinese
gambling as you are yourself, and if I can be of any service
to you, pray commend me.
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>You are very kind, sir. </p><stage>(Shudders and crosses over
to Anstey.)</stage> <p>Take me away from here. </p><stage>(Both exit

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<stage>(Crosses to McGee.)</stage><p> Ah, Mr. McGee.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.
Hello, Sing.
</speaker>
<p>Sing.
I no see you a long time.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Going to the Derby, I suppose.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>That's it. His Majesty has sent me here to write of the
English and American sports. There are his four favorite
wards. </p><stage>(Over to girls, repeats Chinese speech.)</stage> <p>Hung Tung,
Hi la Muck a Wing. Sung Fing Ko To la ma Fo Lung, Ching tee.
I told them who you were.</p></sp>

from hotel, Sing goes extreme R. Laughing from inside.)</stage>
<stage>(Sing sits down)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Talking off)</stage><p> That's right, make a fool out of me. That's
the way with you Englishmen, you're always kidding the
poor Americans. </p><stage>(Turns and sees Chinese women)</stage> <p>Hello,
what's this? A Chinese comic opera? </p><stage>(To ladies)</stage> <p>How
do do, ladies.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<stage>(Gets up.)</stage><p> How do you do, sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson</speaker>
<p>Just the fellow I want to see. </p><stage>(Goes over to Sing.)</stage>
<p>Say, if I give you some laundry to-night, can I get it
Friday night?</p> <stage>(Sing gets very sore. A lot of Chinese
talk. In his anger walks up and down, talking to Chinese
girls.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Goes over to McGee.)</stage><p> Gee, he's got a mean disposition.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughing)</stage><p> He's no laundryman.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>What is he, a juggler, or a musician?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>He's the editor of a Chinese newspaper sent here by the
Emperor.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Over to Sing.)</stage><p> Oh, I beg your pardon. I didn't know you
were a press agent.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Press Agent! Press Agent! </p><stage>(Thinks it over.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>How's everything in China?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>China's doing nicely.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>How's the emp----</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>You're an American, aren't you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>I don't look like a Dago, do I?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Here to see the Derby.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>To tell you the truth, I don't know what I'm here for. I
got on a boat in New York to bid a friend good-bye, and I
fell asleep. When I awoke I was all at sea. My wife is
waiting for me on the dock. That's ten days ago. </p><stage>(McGee
laughs)</stage> <p>She's still waiting for me on the dock. Now I'M
even.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>And how is that?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>She used to keep me waiting for her out in front of Siegel
&amp; Cooper's. I remember one day she kept me waiting pretty
near three days. </p><stage>(McGee and Wilson talking and laughing

<p>Well, Jonsey, old boy, how are you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Fine and dandy. Boston nobby. Fat and fine and splendid.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>How did you leave Paris?</p></sp>

</p><stage>(Starter exits in hotel)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Comes down stage to Jones.)</stage><p> Say, boy, will you join me
in a drink?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(Crosses Mack to Wilson.)</stage><p> No, thanks, nothing doing.
</p><stage>(Crosses Wilson to table, extreme right)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(To Mack)</stage><p> How about you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Crosses him to table)</stage><p> Not for mine.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>I must have company. A drink is no good without sociability.
Sociability is no good without a drink.

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs)</stage><p> That's a good speech. </p><stage>(Sits down left chair.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but it doesn't make me thirsty. </p><stage>(Sits down right chair.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Well, I'll see you boys later. Make it as late as possible.
I'm a late boy. </p><stage>(Starts to go up stage. Turns.)</stage><p> If you see
anything of King Edmund trotting along here, tell him I'm
satisfied with life.</p> <stage>(Jones and McGee watch him until off.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>He's a nice fellow.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Oh, he's all right.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.
I like him.
</speaker>
<p>McGee
</p><stage>(Business, gives him a side look)</stage> <p>I can see that.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Who is he, Mack?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Nobody to know.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>What brought you to London?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.
You.

Jones.</speaker>
<p>How's that?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>You're going back to America?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Yes, with bells on.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>I want you, Jones.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.
What for?
</speaker>
<p>McGee.
Because you're the best jockey in the world. Name your price,
I'll - - -</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Let's not talk shop, Mack. I've half way agreed to ride for

<sp><speaker>McGee.
Anstey?
</speaker>
<p>Jones.
I didn't say.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>No, but I've heard - - - -</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>You mustn't believe all you hear. Anyhow I don't expect to
ride much longer.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Are you going to retire - marry, settle down, give up the
track forever.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>[HANDWRITTEN:
Jones.</speaker>
<p>Someday.]</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs.)</stage><p> Impossible.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Nothing of the sort. I'm a free born American, twenty-one
years of age, and I can do as I please, I guess.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>And who's the fair damsel?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>The sweetest girl in California.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>When did this all happen?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Two years ago.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>When you were riding in 'Frisco?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.
Yes.

McGee.</speaker>
<p>Say, when did you first see her?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>You want to know everything.
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Well, I'd like to know that much.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Well, it's a long story, Mack.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Well, I'll listen to it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Would you like to hear it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.
I would.
</speaker>
<p>Jones.
The first time I saw her, I was perched on a 50 to 1 shot
that ought to have been dragging on ice wagon.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>You were sitting on the horse.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Yes, going to the post on an old nag. A girl leaned over 
the rail and shouted, I've got a bet on you Jonesy, so out
and win.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>The girl shouted -</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>And then ran away, disappeared, but her face was photographed
and my heart was the film. I can't tell you how I felt
because I don't know myself.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Well, did you win?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Did I win? </p><stage>(Laughs)</stage> <p>Why, I just pushed that old skate's
nose to the barrier and from the second the starter said go-</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Deeply interested)</stage><p> Yes, go on, go on -</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>You'll be betting on this race before you get through.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>By golly, you had me going that time.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Well, I'm not going to grandstand it and describe the race
but on the square, Mack, I could make that scene in Old
Kentucky look like thirty cents.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>And when the race was over you met the girl that looked
over the rail, and she's the girl you're going to marry,
and everything ends happily and so on, etc.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Now you have it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>But how about her parents?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>She has none-lives with her aunt. She's a very wealthy
girl, Mack. Her father was known as the Copper King. His
name was Gerald Gates.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>And the Aunt's name is? --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Kenworth. She's a fanatic on the subject of reform.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>President of the Female Reformers?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.
Yes.

McGee.</speaker>
<p>Why it's like a story in a book.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.
How is that?
</speaker>
<p>McGee.
She's here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.
Who?

McGee.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Kenworth.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Here, in London?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but that's not all. She's engaged to be married.
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.
To whom?
</speaker>
<p>McGee.
Anthony Anstey.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.
The Devil.
</speaker>
<p>McGee.
That's what I think he is.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Must be some mistake. </p><stage>(Gets up - crosses to C.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee. </speaker>
<stage>(Follows to C.)</stage><p> Sure, wasn't I talking with her. Didn't
she tell me the whole business?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>What business?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>About the engagement with Anstey, and how he's going to
introduce her to an English nobleman that they're going
to cart back to America to marry the girl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>An English Nobleman?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Yes, the Earl of something, I forgot the name. Sure I
met Anstey. He introduced me to her and she up and tells
me the whole story.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>There's something behind this Mack.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.
Evidently.
</speaker>
<p>Jones.
Is Anstey here?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.
Certainly.
</speaker>
<p>Jones.
I'll be back in a minute. </p><stage>(Turns to go off L. and McGee
pulls him back.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Here now, Jonsey, keep cool! Don't rush head long into
trouble, think it over. Keep you head, there's lots of time.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(Shakes his hand)</stage><p> You're right, Mack, but I've had my
eye on that fellow for a long time. </p><stage>(Both go to R. Enter
Florabelle from hotel down C. followed by American girls)</stage></sp>

<p>Who said Johnny Jones was here?</p></sp>

shakes hands.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Jonsey. </p><stage>(Turns him around)</stage> <p>Turn around and let me see you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>How do I look?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Just as cute a kid as ever.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>What are you doing in London?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Came to see you win the Derby.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to McGee)</stage><p> Did you hear that, Mack?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>He'll do that all right. </p><stage>(Girls pulling at Fly's dress, seeking
introduction.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to girls)</stage><p> Ladies, allow me. Mr. Johnny Jones, the
American Jockey. </p><stage>(She crosses over to McGee and Jonsey crosses
to girls. They swarm around him like a lot of bees and in
a second he is enclosed with them. Fly laughingly to McGee.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Pretty soft for Jonsey, eh, Mack?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Oh, when I was a boy I had a lot of women after me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>And how was that?
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>I stole a pocketbook. </p><stage>(They exit arm in arm R.1.E.
laughing.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(Breaks away from girls.)</stage><p> Well, by Jove, this is a treat.
You know I didn't think there were so many Americans in
the whole city of London. I suppose you're all going to
the Derby?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>You bet we are.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Want a little tip?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>All.</speaker>
<stage>(Interested)</stage><p> You bet we do.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Pawn your jewelry, go in hock, and play Yankee Doodle straight
to win. </p></sp>
<stage>(American girl exits on run 1.E.R.)</stage>
<stage>
MUSIC CUE. SONG: "YANKEE DOODLE BOY"</stage>
<stage>(After number all exit - both sides. Jones goes into hotel.)</stage>

<stage>MUSIC CUE. </stage><stage>(Enter Mrs. Kenworth and Anstey, R.1.E. arm in arm.)
(Waiter comes and places table and chairs. Jones comes from hotel
down to waiter.)</stage> <stage>(Business, and follows Anstey and Mrs. Kenworth
off door left.)</stage> <stage>(Boy crosses from door R. and exits 1.E.L. Shouting)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Boy.</speaker>
<p>Anthony Anstey. Anthony Anstey!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Come right along old chap. </p><stage>(Enter Henry from hotel and looks
around. Runs up and motions to Goldie O.K. Enter Goldie
in male attire, and goes directly to table R.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Fine day for the Derby.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Glorious indeed.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>A cigarette, Leslie.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Yes ma'am. </p><stage>(Hands her a cigarette.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.
Yes ma'am.
</speaker>
<p>Henry.
I beg your pardon, I mean-yes sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>No, no, Lordship, Lordship!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Yes, of course, your Lordship.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Now remember, I'm the Earl of Bloomsbury.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Very well, your Earlship. Is Earlship correct? What?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Lordship, just Lordship.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Oh, just Lordship.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Yes, can't you think?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>How can I think and keep these whiskers on at the same
time. </p><stage>(Pulls them down.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(Sees waiter, who appears and comes down to Henry.)</stage><p>
Sh---- don't do that around here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>Something wanted sir?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Just one moment, do you want anything Early?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(Disgusted)</stage><p> Don't call me Early.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Don't call you Early, very clever indeed. </p><stage>(Turns to
starter)</stage> <p>No, the Earl doesn't want something.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker><p>
The Earl---</p>
<pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>The Earl, of course the Earl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>The Earl of what, sir?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Why the Earl of Bloomsbury.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>The Earl of Bloomsbury, my word! </p><stage>(Starter crosses to Goldie
and Henry to extreme left.)</stage> <p>I'm pleased to meet you your
Earlship. </p><stage>(Bows and goes up stage, then turns.)</stage> <p>I shall not
forget your Lordship. </p><stage>(Turns and bows again)</stage> <p>Long live
the Earl of Bloomsbury. Hurrah for the Earl of Bloomsbury.
etc., etc. </p><stage>(Exits in hotel)</stage> <stage>(Goldie watches his bewildered.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>What are you strutting around like an ostrich for?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>I can't help it, Goldie, I'm nervous.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Well, don't get nervous and don't call me Goldie.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>All right your steamship.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(Gives him a look)</stage><p>
Steamship.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>No, no I mean your - - - - - what kind of a ship is it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Lordship, just Lordship.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Yes your Lordship. Now tell me what is the idea again?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>The idea is that I am the Earl of Bloomsbury.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Then you're going to marry yourself?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Figuratively speaking. You see Mr. Anstey has never met the
Earl of Bloomsbury. I am going to introduce myself to Mr.
Anstey as that distinguished personage.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>But he has word that the Earl wouldn't be here for a week.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Well the Earl suddenly changed his mind- thought it quite a
lark to pop in and surprise all hands.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Strolls C.)</stage><p> I see, it's an awful chance, though.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>My dear boy we take chances every time we cross the street.
</p><stage>(Hears someone coming)</stage> <p>Sh - - - </p><stage>(Enter Sing Song, Mrs. Kenworth
and Anstey, from door L. down stage. Sing goes to
extreme L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<stage>(Starter coming down from hotel to Henry.)</stage><p> Anything wanted
Sir?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Starter turns goes up stage.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(As they enter)</stage><p> You see, my dear, the English Derby doesn't
come under the head of an ordinary horse race. It is an event
anxiously looked forward to, by all classes of people in
England.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Say, I understand that ministers of the gospel attend.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Really, and do you think it would be perfectly proper
for me to go?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.
Absolutely.
</speaker>
<p>Sing.
Most assuredly. </p><stage>(Sing sits down at table, interested all the
time.)</stage> <stage>(Goldie crosses Henry and over to Anstey, and Fly comes
from hotel and stays on porch sizing things up.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Beg pardon, but could you tell me where I might find a
gentleman named Anthony Anstey?
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Right here sir. </p><stage>(Over to her. This brings Goldie and him C.
Leaves Mrs. Kenworth and Sing L. and Henry R. Henry sits down.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Ah, indeed, that makes it very single. I am the Earl of
Bloomsbury.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Surprised)</stage><p> The Earl?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.
The Earl.
</speaker>
<p>Anstey.
Oh, my dear Earl this is a surprisingly great honor. But I --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>-- my sudden appearances here overwhelms you, I understand.
I thought it best not to linger. Left Berlin right after I
sent you the word of my delay.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Delighted, delighted, my dear Earl. I have so much to say -
so much to talk of. </p><stage>(To Mrs. Kenworth)</stage> <p>My dear Annette,
I have the great honor to present Sir Walter Worthington -
The Earl of Bloomsbury. This lady, your Lordship, is Mrs.
Kenworth, of whom I spoke in my last letter. </p><stage>(Anstey crosses
over to Sing.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Mrs. Kenworth, your niece is the American heiress of
whom I --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Yes, your Lordship, I am Goldie's Aunt.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Pleased, awfully pleased.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside to Sing.)</stage><p> Thing are coming my way, Sing.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p> Evidently.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Calls)</stage><p> Ah, my dear Earl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(Business. Crosses to him.)</stage><p> My dear Anstey - - </p><stage>(Mrs. Kenworth
over toward Henry and looks him over, with lorgnette. Henry
gets up, turns and faces Mrs. Kenworth, and quickly turns
from her. She goes up stage L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>I present Sing Song, Editor of the Pekin Gazette. </p><stage>(At this
Sing gets up and bows to Goldie, and Anstey up stage and
joins Mrs. Kenworth. Florabelle at this point is up stage,
writing in memo, and sizing up the situation. Mrs. Kenworth
strolls up stage and looks Florabelle over.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<stage>(Bows)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Delighted - delighted, delighted, pardon, just a moment.
</p><stage>(Goldie goes over to Henry. Mrs. Kenworth crosses down
stage to extreme left, with Sing and Anstey also at same
time extreme L. Leaving center clear.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<stage>(Down stage-writing.)</stage><p> He introduced her to her Aunt as the Earl
of Bloomsbury. Great Scot what a story. </p><stage>(Up stage L. behind
table.)</stage> <stage>(Everyone interested at what Goldie says.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(To Henry)</stage><p> Leslie, you had best go to the Kings Club, and
inform them that the Prince and myself will desire the
Royal billiard table at seven P.M.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Yes, your Lordship. </p><stage>(Starts to go L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>And I say, Leslie.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Stops)</stage><p> Yes sir.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Cash that draft.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Which one, sir?
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>The one for the sixty thousand pounds.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Yes, your Championship.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(Over to Anstey.)</stage><p> Beastly lot, these servants. </p><stage>(Anstey
Sing and Mrs. Kenworth now sitting at table.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Going to the Derby, your Lordship?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Rather, haven't missed the Derby since my fifth year. </p><stage>(Goldie
goes up around table and down to extreme left - Fly follows.)
(Wilson and McGee enter from hotel, arm in arm, followed by
all the girls laughing and dress the stage.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Wilson and McGee both down stage to Anstey.)</stage><p> Say, I just
had a fight with an English bell boy. He got sore because I
said cricket was a kid's game. </p><stage>(Up stage C.)</stage> <p>CUE -FIFE AND
DRUMS. </p><stage>(All this down stage and looks off R.1.E. Shouting
Here comes the soldiers. At this Reformers appear on balcony-
soldiers enter first E.R. and line up R.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Starter.</speaker>
<p>What's the blooming row, now?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Soldier.</speaker>
<stage>(Steps down.)</stage><p> We are here to excort our Chinese visitor to
the Derby.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<stage>(To C.)</stage><p> Ah, my noble escort. One moment. </p><stage>(Goes and calls
Chinese girls from door L.)</stage> <p>Ah Mila, Ah Moy, Ah Goy, Ah Vong!
</p><stage>(Turns to Soldiers.)</stage> <p>I told them we were ready.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Soldier.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to give order.)</stage><p> Attention, company, left foot forward
march. </p><stage>(Soldiers exit single file 1.E.R. Sing and Chinese
girls follow. McGee and Wilson stroll over to table R. and
sit down.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(Enters from hotel. Comes down stage C. and looks off R.
after soldiers.)</stage><p> Hello, what's all the excitement?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Over to Jones)</stage><p> Jonsey, just the boy I want to see.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside to Anstey)</stage><p> Is this Mrs. Kenworth?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Yes, but for Heaven's sake don't tip my hand as a sporting
man.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>I want to talk to you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>I haven't time now. </p><stage>(Turns to go away.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(Pulls him around)</stage><p> Well you'll make time to talk to me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Just what I say. You're playing a crooked game Mr. Anstey,
and I'm going to find out what it is.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Why, you young rat I'll - - - </p><stage>(Scream by all)</stage> <stage>(Attempts
to strike a blow with cane, and Jones wrests it from him and
breaks it.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>There goes your cane, Anstey, and your neck will be next if you
don't stop where you are. </p><stage>(Throws cane away.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Why Anthony, what does this mean?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you what it means, Mrs. Kenworth, I'm engaged to
your niece, and have been ever since I left 'Frisco a year ago.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.
WHAT?</speaker>
<p>
Anstey.
Do you hear this, Mrs. Kenworth? This common jockey, this
rat of the stables, engaged to your niece.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>This man is mad.
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to all.)</stage><p> A big joke, isn't it - a jockey engaged to
an heiress.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Yes, a gigantic joke.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Is there no protection against a public insult
from a madman?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(To Mrs. Kenworth.)</stage><p> Is there no protection against a woman
of your sort, Mrs. Kenworth? To force upon a young girl an
outrageous marriage with a cur. </p><stage>(Jones points to Goldie
and Goldie laughs.)</stage> <p>who would sell himself for an American
bank roll. </p><stage>(At this Anstey steps close to Jones.)</stage> <p>You just
called me a rat Anstey.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>That's what you are and for this insult I'll drive you
from the track, if it takes every dollar I possess.
</p><stage>(Everybody interested.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>You'll never do that. If your record was as clean as mine,
you'd have a good appetite and many a good night's rest. I never
bet on a mount or rode a crooked race in all my life, and you've
turned every dirty trick that's known to the racing world -
fixed your jockeys - pulled your horses, and fooled the public
time after time, and you call me a rat?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>That's what you are.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>I wasn't too much of a rat to receive this check from you 
ten days ago, Anstey, </p><stage>(At this Jones tears up check, and at
finish of speech throws check in Anstey's face. Everybody
horror struck.)</stage> <p>But I don't want your kind of money, and there's
your check, there it is, right square in your face. </p><stage>(A scream
by all. Mrs. Kenworth goes up stage and exits in door L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(To Jones)</stage><p> I'm not through with you yet. </p><stage>(Up stage and
follows Mrs. Kenworth off.)</stage></sp>

<p>Yes, he's a fine fellow.

<stage>(Turns)</stage><p> Hope I won't be sick! Well, how do you suppose the
doctors are going to make a living if we don't get sick every
once in a while. Gee, whiz, if you had your way you'd put all
practicing physicicans out of business. You've got the meanest
disposition of any woman I ever met in all my life. </p><stage>(Exits
boat.)</stage> <stage>(Girls all laugh as he exits and stroll to C.)
(Captain approaching first girl goes left.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<stage>(To girl)</stage><p> Tell me, who is that fellow?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>I don't know.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>A boat gambler I presume. I'll keep my eye on him. </p><stage>(Both
go C. At this boy comes from L.2.E. and joins Captain.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Girl.</speaker>
<p>I hope we don't have a storm at sea.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs as girls shudder.)</stage><p> A storm at sea to me is as welcome
as the sunshine of a spring morning to a birdie in its nest.
When the thunger crashes -- </p><stage>(Girls shudder)</stage> <p>and the lightning
flashes --</p><stage>(Girls shudder)</stage> <p>the rain pours down, the pyramid
waves splash the deck - the old ship is rocking like a cradle
and the --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Girls</speaker>
<p>Ah, Captain!</p> <stage>(1st girl exits aboard ship - seasick.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs)</stage><p> Bah, sailors, eh? </p><stage>(Laughs)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>2nd Girl.</speaker>
<p>Captain have you always been a sailor?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>No indeed, when I was a boy like this lad I worked in a
store. </p><stage>MUSIC CUE. </stage><stage>(SONG- "Captain of a Ten-Day Boat", sung by
Captain and Girls, sad boys enter at introduction from ship
and do number with them. At finish all exit R.2.E. Also
boy and Captain stays left. Florabelle appears on deck
of boat at finish of this number with kodak, and coming
down plank laughing.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Captain Squirvy entertains the American girls with a sailor's
hornpipe on the Southampton Dock. More news for the Searcher.
</p><stage>(Approachs Captain - laughing)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to Fly and greets her)</stage><p> Ah, Miss Fly, going to cross?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>With you again, Captain. </p><stage>(Goes down stage L. and turns.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>Well, well, with Sing Song, the Chinese newspaper man, and
Florabelle Fly, the press will be well represented on the
St. Hurrah.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>A boat load of celebrities, eh, Captain?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>Yes, indeed, I suppose you know Johnny Jones crosses with
us.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Yes, poor Jones.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>That's what I say, Fly. Why in the world was he ever ruled
off the English track?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>No one seems to know.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>Do you suppose it was because he lost the English Derby?
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Well, of course his horse was favorite, but then other
favorites have lost. </p><stage>(Bus. Fly taking Captain's picture.)</stage>
<p>Stand up straight, fix your tie. There have been no facts
made public. We only know he's off the track.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>There's something behind it all.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Evidently, but it's all a mystery up to now. </p><stage>(Shouting and
yelling and laughing without.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>Hello, what's this? </p><stage>(Both up stage.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Mrs. Kenworth and her female Reformers have arrived.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, I read of them in the London Times. Sing Song
is to accompany them back to San Francisco I see.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<stage>(Crosses to extreme R.)</stage><p> Yes, going to protect them from the
Highbinders. </p><stage>(Laughs.)</stage> <p>She's proved a great subject for the
press.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<stage>(Goes L.)</stage><p> A better subject for an insane asylum, I should
say. </p><stage>(At this Mrs. Kenworth enters from R.2.E. preceded
by boy with grips.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Boy.</speaker>
<p>Here you are, here's the St. Hurrah. Right this way, Ma'am.
</p><stage>(Enter Mrs. Kenworth)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<stage>(Sees her)</stage><p> Why Mrs. Kenworth. </p><stage>(At same time snapping her
picture.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Ah, Miss Fly, awfully glad to hear that you are going
to make the trip with us.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>I'm tickled to death myself. Have you met Captain Squirvy,
Mrs. Kenworth - </p><stage>(Introduction)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<stage>(Bows in acknowledgment)</stage><p> Mrs. Kenworth!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Captain? Captain of the St. Hurrah?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<stage>(Swells up)</stage><p>
Yes, madam.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>I suppose you have crossed the ocean many times.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>A hundred and three times, madam, and twice in a row boat.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Brave fellow. I like brave men. </p><stage>(Captain swells
out.)</stage> <p>I adore brave women who stand by their rights.
</p><stage>(Turns to Fly and back again.)</stage> <stage>(At this boy comes from
ship - crosses to R. bus. with trunk.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p> Here's one who stands by her rights alright, alright,
alright.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>I've heard a great deal of you Mrs. Kenworth through the
newspapers.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Newspapers! Rubbish. </p><stage>(Captain crosses to C. Mrs.
Kenworth to L. and looks up at boat.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>I wonder if she was looking at me when she said that.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>It looks that way.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to Captain.)</stage><p> Have my little dearies arrived
yet, Captain?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to Mrs. Kenworth.)</stage><p> Yes, half hour ago.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Will you be so kind as to present them to the
stewardess, my dear Captain?
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>With pleasure, my dear Mrs. Kenworth, and I assure you the
pleasure is all mine. I will see to them at once. </p><stage>(Goes
up plank and off ship.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<stage>(Goes over to Mrs. Kenworth.)</stage><p> Tell me, is it true the Earl of
Bloomsbury is to marry your niece, Mrs. Kenworth?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Yes, indeed. Ah, lucky girl. An Earl for a husband.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Then her engagement to the American jockey Jones is ----</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(Interrupts her)</stage><p> ---Jones, that insignificant, horrid
creature. Whatever foolish escapade my niece may have
had with this jockey was a joke, a mere lark. Goldie
is fascinating, I might say coquetteish, and the poor
fool took her seriously. </p><stage>(Laughs)</stage> <stage>(At this sailors
enter from R.2.E. and Boy exits R.2.E.)</stage> <p>Ridiculous,
ridiculous. </p><stage>(Laughs haughtily and exits aboard ship.
Sailors take trunks and exit aboard ship.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>The story gets stranger as the chapters progress. </p><stage>(This is
aside.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Without)</stage><p> Come along your lordship, right this way, your
lordship.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<stage>(Up stage, looks off R.)</stage><p> Hello, here comes my heroine now,
from England to America in male attire, and the Searcher scoops
the story. </p><stage>(Down stage as Goldie and Henry enter, turns and
snaps them with her kodak. Enter Henry carrying grips, and so
followed by Goldie still disguised as the Earl.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Goes L.)</stage><p> Here we are, your lordship, here's the St. Hurrah.
Shall we go right aboard?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>May as well, I suppose. </p><stage>(Looks at ship)</stage> <p>Beastly looking
boat, isn't it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>Yes, awful looking catamoran.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns sees Fly.)</stage><p> Ah, Miss Fly. </p><stage>(Tipping hat)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Howdy, my dear Earl. I suppose you're anxious for the trip
to be over with, and see what your future wife really looks
like. </p><stage>(Both come C.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>I don't care what she looks like.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns)</stage><p> He wouldn't care if she looked like thirty cents.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Has Miss Gates heard of the match?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>I believe her Aunt cabled her the good news, that I had
agreed to become her husband. Ah, she's the lucky girl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>What do you suppose the outcome will be?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>I don't care what the outcome is.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<p>No, by Jove it's the income he's after. </p><stage>(Turns and looks
at boat)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>But I understand this girl is in love with Johnny Jones, the
jockey.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>If she marries him she's disinherited.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Jones don't care, he loves her for herself.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Do you think so?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.
He told me so.
</speaker>
<p>Goldie.
</p><stage>(Overjoyed)</stage> <p>He did, when?
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns and coughs at this point.)</stage><p> Don't you think we'd best
get aboard, your Lordship? </p><stage>(Fly walks up stage)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Put the luggage in my stateroom, Leslie.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Down to Goldie, aside)</stage><p> Don't talk too much.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p> Leave that to me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p> I never did like these female newspaper men. </p><stage>(Starts
exit aboard ship.)</stage> <p>Coming right aboard your silly old boat,
Captain, and you shall make way for the Earl of Bloomsbury.
</p><stage>(At this Wilson comes down plank and meets Henry, who look
each other over.)</stage> <stage>(Henry turns from Wilson.)</stage> <p>My word, what
a silly looking man.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Say, how do you expect the expressman to make a living if
you are going to carry that stuff around with you all the
time?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<stage>(Crosses Wilson and up plank.)</stage><p> You mind your own business
you old fool, and if you don't I'll give you a piece of my
mind, you silly old sponge cake.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Follows him)</stage><p> Now don't get sore Clare, he'll be great company
for me, all right. </p><stage>(Both exit ship)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(To fly who comes down stage R.)</stage><p> And so you really think
this Jones would marry Miss Gates if she hadn't a dollar in
the world?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Undoubtedly, but I hardly think she'll care for him now that
he's disgracefully accused of throwing the English Derby. I
understand his suspension extends to America, and that he is
actually ruled off the track forever.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>She loves him just the same.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>What makes you think so?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Oh, silly fools, these girls you know.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs - goes over to plank.)</stage><p> Are you going aboard, my dear
Earl? </p><stage>(Goes up plank.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(Goes over to trunk R.)</stage><p> No, I'm going to sit here and watch
the sailors bid good-bye to their sweethearts.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Jimney Christmas, what a story this is getting to be. </p><stage>(Exits
aboard ship) MUSIC CUE. (SONG - "GOOD-BYE FLO" Sung by Goldie
with chorus behind her. At finish crowd hollering and shouting
without. Goldie and sailors exit aboard ship, and girls exit
R.2.E. Enter McGee on run from R.2.E.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>By gorra, I never got in a crowd like that in my life. They're
trying to mob poor Jonsey. Swarmed around him like a lot of
bees. </p><stage>(Yelling and hollering and Bus.)</stage> <stage>(Yells)</stage> <p>Go it,
Jonsey, go it. He soaked one of them, down he goes. Give
it to him again. </p><stage>(Supposed to be looking at fight off R.)</stage>
<p>Come on, come on, and lick the devil ----- </p><stage>(Enter Jones with
jeers, hisses and yelling)</stage> <p>Are you all right? Turn around
and let me see. </p><stage>(Turns Jonsey around)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Why, I could fight my way through as an army of ours like them.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Who the devil started it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.
Anstey!
</speaker>
<p>McGee.
Anstey.
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>The minute I stepped from the train he shouted to the crowd,
"there he is Johnny Jones, the crooked jockey", why they
were on top of me before I where I was at. </p><stage>(Goes down
stage R.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Where is the kid that had our grips?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(To kid as he enters with grips)</stage><p> Ah, there you are! Good boy!
</p><stage>(He starts to walk plank - Jones follows, boy turns.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Boy.</speaker>
<p>Good boy nothing. If I'd have known as who you were I'd never
carried your blooming luggage. Johnny Jones, eh? Threw the
English Derby, did you? </p><stage>(Hisses him.)</stage> <p>I hope the next horse
you get on falls down and breaks your blooming neck. </p><stage>(Tails)</stage>
<p>Robber, thief, cad!</p> <stage>(Hisses - exits aboard ship.)</stage> <stage>(Enter
Wilson on deck and listens.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(To McGee)</stage><p> I'm a hot favorite, Mack. </p><stage>(Down stage R.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Follows him)</stage><p> You are in bad luck, kid.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>I throw the English Derby? Why I never tried so hard in all
my life, yet for the last three days every kid in the streets
of London has jeered me - pointed me out to passers-by with
calls of thief! Robber! Cad! and all such things.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Goes C.)</stage><p> And no satisfaction from the English Club?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Not a bit. Called before the steward and suspended. Called
before the committee and ruled off. No satisfaction, no
explanation, except what the papers have printed and they
merely intimate that I may have ridden a crooked race.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>And even if you did, you're not the first that - - -</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Wait a minute, Mac. Do you think I did?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns)</stage><p> I didn't say that, Jonsey.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(McGee goes extreme R.)</stage><p> No, but you may as well. Gee, whiz!
Haven't I a friend in the world? </p><stage>(McGee offers Jones his
hand. Wilson, who has just come down plank.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Have you got any money?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>I've got all kinds of money.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>To hell with the friends. </p><stage>(Goes and looks off R.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Jones and McGee cross Wilson and look at him surprised and
go up stage L.)</stage><p> There's no hand, kid. I'm going to go the
route for you and stick right with you till you prove to the
whole damn world that you are on the square.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>That's awfully nice of you, Mack. </p><stage>(Cheers, and shouts in
distance at this)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(Looking off R.)</stage><p> I guess I'll get aboard before I'm mobbed
again. </p></sp>
<stage>(Jones, McGee and Wilson go aboard ship and stay there.)</stage>
<stage>
MUSIC CUE - FORTE. </stage><stage>(ENTER TOMMY ATKINS SOLDIERS AND SING SONG; AND the
Four Chinese Girls, who do big number and dance. At finish of dance
Chinese girls exit aboard ship, and Tommy Atkins Soldiers exit R.2.E.

Henry comes on deck, now listening. BOTH. Sailors are on the deck all

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<stage>(Coming down plank at finish of number.)</stage><p> Ah, my dear Sing
Song, welcome to the St. Hurrah.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing Song.</speaker>
<p>Captain Squirvy, I believe.

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>At your service.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing Song.</speaker>
<p>I've heard Mr. Anstey speak of you. </p><stage>(Crosses to left and
meets Mrs. Kenworth who is coming down plank. Captain

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Where is Anthony?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing Song.</speaker>
<p>He's with the police. </p><stage>(They both go down stage L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>With the police.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>The Earl of Bloomsbury turned out to be a bogus Earl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>A bogus Earl?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>So it seems. Anstey is now giving the detectives a full
description of the counterfeit.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>He's already aboard the ship. </p><stage>(Crosses to C.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Good. I believe they intend to surround the boat and capture
him at once.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Will wonders never cease?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>They'll get him if he's aboard the ship.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>He's aboard the ship right now.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Heny.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside)</stage><p> But he won't be in a minute. </p><stage>(Exits into ship hurriedly)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Oh, this is horrible, terrible.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns.)</stage><p> What seems to be the matter?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Nothing, everything. </p><stage>(Enter Anstey with inspector. R.2.E.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Come along Perkins.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(Up to him)</stage><p> Ah, Anthony!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Inspector stops)</stage><p> You heard!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Yes, what does it mean?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Isnpector.</speaker>
<p>Imprisonment for life, Ma'am if we get the man.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>Inspector Perkins!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Inspector.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns at mention of name)</stage><p> Hello, Captain. </p><stage>(Shakes hands)</stage>
<p>May I have your permission to search the St. Hurrah for a
person enrolled on the passenger list as the Earl of
Bloomsbury?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>Go as far as you like, Inspector. Come along, I'll help
you. This way, Inspector. </p><stage>(Crosses - goes up plank and
exits.)</stage> <stage>(Inspector follows to plank and stops, turns to Anstey)
(By this time Sing Song has gone up stage and has joined
Anstey and Mrs. Kenworth.)</stage> <stage>(At this Wilson comes aboard
ship and down plank.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Inspector.</speaker>
<stage>(To Anstey.)</stage><p> Have no fear Mr. Anstey, I'll take him dead
or alive. </p><stage>(Inspector starts up plank and meet Wilson who
is just coming down - then stops.)</stage> <p>Hello, Wilson, how are
you? </p><stage>(Holding out hand. Jones exits into ship.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>There must be some mistake. </p><stage>(Anstey, Sing and Mrs. Kenworth
stand at R.2.E. pantomine talk.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Inspector.</speaker>
<stage>(Wilson crosses Inspector.)</stage><p> I beg your pardon, I thought
you were somebody else.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Well, if I ain't somebody you thought I was, I must be
somebody else.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Inspector.</speaker>
<stage>(Exits aboard ship, saying)</stage><p> All right, Captain, I'm coming.
</p><stage>(Exits on run. Wilson goes up stage.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>How did you discover him to be an imposter?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Shakes letter in hand)</stage><p> This letter.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>From the real Earl?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Exactly I've wired him to follow on the next boat.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>The wretch may approach my dearies. I must protect
them at once. </p><stage>(Goes aboard ship.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Nothing to fear now, my dear.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>But the brute may speak to them. </p><stage>(Exit hurriedly and
excited into boat. Anstey goes over to boat and sees
her exit.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Who do you suppose this masquerading person can be?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Some imposter or fool taking a desperate chance. </p><stage>(Goes over
to Sing.)</stage> <p>The Chinese Lottery papers, where are they?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<stage>(Takes papers from sleeve.)</stage><p> There they are.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.
Oh!

Sing.</speaker>
<p>I see Jones' name is on the passenger list.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Yes, the little rat.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>He'll beat the Earl to the field of battle.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Will he? I'll cable Chung Fow to kidnap the girl. On Mrs.
Kenworth's arrival in Frisco she will learn of the disappearance
of her niece.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>What's the scheme?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Ransom money for the girl's release, and a promise of
silence, and no more uprising against the Chinese Lottery
game.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>It's blackmail.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Not at all. Business proposition.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Tell me, how was that jockey affair arranged?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Easily enough. On the day of the Derby I circulated a report
that Jones was bought by an American syndicate to throw the
race. My appearance at the track strengthened the story to
such an extent that the American colony watched every move
I made. I took a long chance on Jones' defeat; bet six
thousand pounds on British Boy, which put the English betting
ring into a wild turmoil. Long before the race was run,
Jones was called before the Stewards. He must have convinced
them of his innocence, for he went to the post on Yankee
Doodle. Now had he finished our ot the money, under ordinary
circumstances, well and good, but meeting defeat in the face
of the accusation and the American Money switching over
to the long shot, British Boy, brought the English to their
feet with a cry of fraud. He was mobbed in the paddock,
barely escaped with his life. Jones unconditionally suspended

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>The whole scheme has to be handled with gloves, my dear
Sing Song, and no one but a conniving, scheming, deep-
thinking man, could have succesfully operated this little
game I played, for sweet revenge. I'll not soon forget the
insult he publicly hurled at me in the Court of the Hotel
Cecil. </p><stage>(Anstey laughs heartily. Wilson who has been up
stage now pushes his way in between the two.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Say, will you boys join me in a little drink?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>No clinky. </p><stage>(Turns up stage L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>I'm just as much obliged.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>You boys are great commons all right.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Beg pardon -- </p><stage>(Business of brushing off his shoulder with

papers in his own pocket.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns)</stage><p> What's the matter?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>I thought I saw some dust on your shoulder.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>You're liable to see a lot of things the way you are going.

</p><stage>(Turns - goes up stage L.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<stage>(Up stage)</stage><p> I wonder if they captured the counterfeit Earl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Inspector.</speaker>
<p>No, he's vanished. Disappeared entirely.</p></sp>

Sing, I'm coming. </p><stage>(Exits both hurriedly)</stage></sp>

<p>She looks like the real thing, eh?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>I should say she does.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Strange this Earl should turn out to be an imposter.</p></sp>

<stage>(Looking about)</stage><p> Absolutely sure. I tell you, Captain, I've
been robbed. </p><stage>(Goes to R.C.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Something lost?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain</speaker>
<p>Valuable papers.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Yes, very valuable papers. It's the work of a thief.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>I don't know who the thief can be. </p><stage>(At this point Jones
down stage to Anstey and stops.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns - sees Jones and looks at him.)</stage><p> I think I do. A man
who will cheat the public will pick a pocket. </p><stage>(At this
point Mrs. Kenworth enters from ship)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>Look out for your watch, Captain. </p><stage>(Turns and goes up to side
of plank. Bus. of Captain throwing up hands - turns and
goes up stage.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<stage>(Aside.)</stage><p> Anstey loses valuable papers. </p><stage>(Anstey turns up
stage - sees Mrs. Kenworth on plank.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Ah, my dear. </p><stage>(Descends plank)</stage> <p>The papers.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>It's nothing. Papers of importance in a business way, that's
all. </p><stage>(Mrs. Kenworth crosses over to Fly L. At this the
four Bobbies appear on plank.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Bobby.</speaker>
<p>Is the Inspector about, Governor?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>No, what luck?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Bobby.</speaker>
<p>None. Our man is not aboard this ship.
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>I'm glad of that.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Then, where the devil is he?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Strange!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Fly.</speaker>
<p>Very. </p><stage>(Noises of crowd yelling and jeering without.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<stage>(Looking off R.)</stage><p> What's this? </p><stage>(Shrill whistle blows at
this point)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st Bobby.</speaker>
<p>That's for us. </p><stage>(Four bobbies exit on a run from ship
to R.2.E.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>What's up now? </p><stage>(At this point Wilson appears on plank.
Sailor enters at this R.2.E.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sailor.</speaker>
<stage>(Excited, salutes Captain, takes Captain by the hand and
goes down stage C.)</stage><p> Captain, big crowd, police driving
back. They want to get the ship to mob Johnny Jones.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Captain.</speaker>
<p>Mob Johnny Jones?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<stage>(Going extreme L.)</stage><p> I can see my finale.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughing to Mrs. Kenworth)</stage><p> Come my dear, we'd best get
aboard. </p><stage>(Captain, Fly and Mrs. Jenworth exit aboard ship)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Down to Jones, and slips him a pistol.)</stage><p> Here use this if
it comes to a show down. </p><stage>(Enter McGee from ship in haste)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Appears on deck)</stage><p> What's all the fuss? </p><stage>(Everything excitement
around stage and jeering of crowd is heard without.
Mob scene here. Mob enter with police trying to fight
them back. At this Wilson and Jones shoot off pistol.
Mob who get frightened, turn and run off R.2.E. lots of
noise.)</stage> <stage>(As mob exits Tommy Atkins boy enter from aboard
ship, down stage.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(All excited, over to Wilson)</stage><p> Do you know what you are doing?
Do you know all England has been cheated, robbed by this
our you are trying to protect? Who are you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>I'm a Democrat. </p><stage>(Anstey exits hurriedly into ship. Wilson
down stage C. calling.)</stage> <p>Come here, everybody. </p><stage>(All surround
him. Inspector at his right. Jones and Hapgood at L.)</stage>
<p>This man Anstey is scheming to drive Johnny Jones out of
England.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>But he'll not do it. I'll stick here and prove that I'm on
the level.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hapgood.</speaker>
<p>That's the boy, Jonsey. </p><stage>(Shakes his hand)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>I'll have a written confession of his scheme before the ship
is two hours out.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Inspector.</speaker>
<p>What's the inducement?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Takes papers from pocket and shows them)</stage><p> These papers.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Inspector.</speaker>
<p>I'll report to headquarters. You signal Lizard Island.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.
How?
</speaker>
<p>Inspector.
By a skyrocket from the ship.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Good! A skyrocket from the ship at Lizard Island will
prove that Johnny Jones is on the square.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Jones.</speaker>
<p>If that rocket goes off I'll be on the next boat.

<stage>(Enter Wilson up stage - R.3.E. and meets policeman L.C.)</stage>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Say, excuse me. Could you tell me where I can find a policeman?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Officer.</speaker>
<p>Are you speaking to me?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Certainly I'm speaking to you. How do you suppose people 
are going to get acquainted if they don't speak to each other.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Officer.</speaker>
<p>Move on, move on. </p><stage>(Crosses him -goes up to R.U.E. and

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Gee, you've got a mean disposition. </p><stage>(Shouting and yelling

<sp><speaker>Officer.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns and goes to Wilson.)</stage><p> The Chinamen are celebrating
the arrival of Sing Song.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.
Who is he?
</speaker>
<p>Officer.
A Chinese newspaper man, sent here by the Emperor to study

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Gee, I thought it was Grover Cleveland's birthday. </p><stage>(Turns

<sp><speaker>Officer.</speaker>
<p>Are you looking for somebody?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Yes, I want to find a policeman.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Officer.</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>

<sp><speaker>Chinamen.</speaker>
<p>Yes, all right.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Tell Anstey I'm here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chinaman.
Wilson?
</speaker>
<p>Wilson.
Yes, Wilson. </p><stage>(Chinaman disappears into den)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Starts to go R.C.)</stage><p> This is a nice, cheerful little place.
If I lived in 'Frisco I'd hang out here all the time.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Enters from down left, slaps door behind him and looks all
about until he sees Wilson, R.C.)</stage><p> Is that you? </p><stage>(Comes down
C. and stops.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>No. --This is me, -- that's you there.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Well, I'm here, I kept my word.
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Yes, for the first time in your life.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Goes to strike him with cane.)</stage><p> What?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Here. Put it down, put it down. Don't force me to chastize
you. Be a nice good little boy and listen to me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Puts down cane.)</stage><p> Go on, don't waste words - you know my
disposition. </p><stage>(Turns away.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Yes, you've got a damn mean disposition.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns to Wilson.)</stage><p> You've got me cornered Wilson, but
don't torture me, please don't torture me! </p><stage>(Turns aside.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>I'm not going to. However a few words will not be amiss.
To begin with, Mr. Anstey, the lottery King - </p><stage>(Anstey turns.)</stage>
<p>I've been after you since you first began to deal that
crooked game in the Chinese quarter. Any time you crossed
the Pacific or the Atlantic I was within shooting distance.
It took me three years to lend you and now you make one
wrong move, or refuse to write or do anything I dictate,
and I'll send you up for the rest of your natural existance.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Starts to walk away L.)</stage><p> And if I turn state's evidence -</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>You're a free man, pretty soft, eh? </p><stage>(Wilson laughs at him
as he grits his teeth.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns and stops.)</stage><p> Laugh. Ruin a man, then laugh at his
disgrace.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Why didn't you think of that when you tried to put that
little jockey out of business in England?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>Well, that's all past and gone. Hasn't be been reinstated?
Hasn't my written confession ruled me off the track forever?
I'm a ruined man, - what more do you want?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>I want that kidnapped girl before I leave Chinatown.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>The Chinamen know nothing of her disappearance.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson</speaker>
<p>You cabled Chung Fow to kidnap the girl.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<p>But the girl was not in Frisco.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Anstey if you lie to me, I'll make you break stones twelve
hours a day for the next twenty years.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Over to Wilson.)</stage><p> Well, I'll submit to the inevitable, anything
you say, but don't send me away, please don't.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Points to den left.)</stage><p> Go in there and wait for me, and
don't forget the job in the stone yard I spoke about.
</p><stage>(Shouts)</stage> <p>Go on - Twenty-three.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Anstey.</speaker>
<stage>(Bus. Hesitatingly.)</stage> <stage>(Exits into den and slams the door
after him.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>He's what I call a nice little fellow. </p><stage>(Looks at watch.)</stage>
<p>It's about time McGee kept his appointment. He's fifteen
minutes late. </p><stage>(Shouts and yells heard without at this.)</stage><stage>
(Wilson goes L. Enter McGee and Mrs. Kenworth R.U.E.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>It's all right now, cheer up. The whole town is on the
search. </p><stage>(Looks off R.)</stage> <p>Wilson was to be here at eleven,
and -----</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>It's a quarter past eleven now.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns, surprised)</stage><p> Hello.
</p><pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(Crosses to him quickly.)</stage><p> Tell me, is there any news?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Goes to her.)</stage><p> Now don't get excited. Everything will
turn out all right. She's in safe keeping even if she is
kidnapped.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Of course, sure they're only waiting for the ransom.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>I'll pay anything. Promise silence, but --</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>The best thing you can do is to keep quiet. I'll find the
girl before the night is over.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Do, and I'll reward you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>I don't want any reward, I want to talk to you. </p><stage>(At this
McGee goes upstage and looks off right.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>I am tickled to death to see you with this man - McGee. </p><stage>(At
mention of his name McGee turns and swells up.)</stage> <p>He's a
good man - I know him. He's a Brooklyn Elk. You don't want
to overlook this jockey Jones. They may have fixed that
horse in England but they couldn't fix the jockey. He's
the candy all right. I don't blame your niece for getting
sweet on him. </p><stage>(At this McGee strolls down stage.)</stage> <p>but
this man with the gray looks. He's no good, arouse mit him.
I'm going to get him to sign this, the skedew. I want to
give you a little bit of advice.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, go on.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Give up this band of reformers and let the Chinamen alone.
Don't dictate to anyone whom they should marry. Stay at
home, do your knitting and sewing and let the rest of the
world take care of itself.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Why sir, I ---</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Now don't mind me; that was on my chest and I had to get it
off - That's all.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<stage>(Crosses her to Wilson.)</stage><p> Where's Jones? </p><stage>(Mrs. Kenworth goes
up stage R.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Jones is doing a little detective work on his own hook.
</p><stage>(Drums beating without again and big noise. All up stage
look off R.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>What's this?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Sing Song's reception in Chinatown. </p><stage>(All down stage C.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Now go take a walk and come back in about ten minutes, and
if I haven't got your niece by that time it's because she's
not in Frisco. </p><stage>(Mrs. Kenworth and McGee start to exit)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns)</stage><p> How can I ever thank you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Send me an invitation to the wedding.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>We'll do that.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<stage>(Looks at McGee.)</stage><p> What?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Oh, I forget ----</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Mrs. Kenworth.</speaker>
<p>Why Mr. McGee, I'm surprised, I -----</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>McGee.</speaker>
<p>Slip of the tongue--slip of the tongue. </p><stage>(They exit arm in
arm laughing L.1.E.)</stage>
<pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Over to den R. and nears in.)</stage><p> I wonder how Jones is getting
on with his detective work. </p><stage>(Chinaman appears - Enter from
L.U.E. to C. and whistles to Wilson.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<stage>(Turns and over)</stage><p> Good, I've been waiting for you - what's
new?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chinaman.</speaker>
<p>Anstey's right - the girl never was kidnapped.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>I never thought she was.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chinaman.</speaker>
<p>Sing Song's now reviewing Chinatown.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Go in there and tell Anstey to put his signature to this.
</p><stage>(Hands him paper)</stage> <p>Tell him to grab a fast train east. He
won't have a Chinaman's chance in Frisco from the minute he
signs it. </p><stage>(Chinaman goes over to den L. raps on door and
when the slit is raised says "Ho la ha." Door opens and he
exits into den L.)</stage> <stage>(Wilson goes to extreme R.1.E. takes
out watch and looks.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Wilson.</speaker>
<p>Quarter past eleven. Quarter past eleven. Gee I'm glad I'm
not in Boston. </p><stage>(Enter Chinaman R.U.E. down stage and exit
into den L. Enter Hapgood from R.U.E. and looks all
around followed by Goldie, who is veiled.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hapgood.</speaker>
<p>She's disappeared but I'm almost certain she came this way.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(R stage C.)</stage><p> Was she alone?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hapgood.</speaker>
<stage>(L. stage C.)</stage><p> Oh, no, McGee was with her. He's been
running in and out of the Pinkerton offices all day. The
whole town's on a search for you, Goldie. It ceases to be a
joke.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>What'll I do?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hapgood.</speaker>
<p>Give up this deception. Let people know who you are.
Things are getting serious.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Things are just as I want them. I've at least taught my
Aunt a lesson, and that's what I started out to do.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hapgood.</speaker>
<p>I know, but the notoriety.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>Notoriety. She started all that with her crusading society.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hapgood.</speaker>
<p>But think of Jones. That poor kid has turned Frisco upside
down in search of you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<p>And at the same time convinced my Aunt what a man he is.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hapgood.</speaker>
<p>Great Scott, she's agreed to your marriage, done away with
her society; offered all sorts of rewards for your
restoration. I can't see the sense of carrying things
further.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Goldie.</speaker>
<stage>(Laughs)</stage><p> But just imagine the fun I'm having, reading the
accounts of my disappearance. The kidnapping stories, the
search of Chinatown and so on.....</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hapgood.</speaker>
<stage>(Gets very sore)</stage><p> I don't see anything to laugh at, Goldie.
It's a nightmare with me. </p><stage>(Drums heard without.)</stage> <stage>(Both
run up stage and look off R.)</stage> <stage>(NOTE- As drums beat Wilson
enters from 1.E.R. sees Goldie and Hapgood and watches both
under cover. Hapgood and Goldie run up stage and look off R.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hapgood.</speaker>
<stage>(Down stage C. at R. of guide.)</stage><p> Here comes the Chinese
parade - let's get away from here. </p><stage>(They exit hurriedly L.1.E.
MUSIC CUE. MARCH.)</stage> <stage>(Wilson exits R.1.E.)</stage> <stage>(At finish 
of march the Chinese are left on stage, and Sing Song enters
with guide from R.U.E.)</stage>
<pb/></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<stage>(Down stage C. at R. of guide.)</stage><p> Wonderful sight--wonderful
sight! One would think China had been transplanted in
America. The Emperor would be proud to behold this settlement--
proud of his people. </p><stage>(Cheers from all)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Guide.</speaker>
<p>This is the famous Chinese gambling den of Frisco.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.
Gambling den?
</speaker>
<p>Guide.
The Chinese lottery game has made it famous.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>A disgrace to our people.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Guide.</speaker>
<p>It's controlled by Americans, I believe.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.
Oh, I see.
</speaker>
<p>Guide.
It's one of the greatest sights of Chinatown - shall we visit
here?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Not in there - not I. We will proceed to the Joss house. Lead
on my good people. </p><stage>(MUSIC CUE- Parade marches off, leaving
Sing Song and Guide alone.)</stage></sp>

<stage>(Starts up stage L.)</stage><p> This way, Sing. </p><stage>(Points to L.U.E.
Sing follows.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Sing.</speaker>
<p>Wait, perhaps 'twould be best were I to visit here. The
Emperor should know of his workings. Come, I will see this
place. </p><stage>(Both go to den L. and guide raps.)</stage></sp>

<sp><speaker>Chinaman.</speaker>
